The constant barking and meowing and the continuous foot traffic from shelter staff and people looking to adopt can be both scary and intimidating. Many cats and dogs are also bewildered as to how they got there in the first place.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Many animals may appear timid, may hide in the back of their cages or may even hide under their bedding. As a result, it can be very difficult to get a grasp of their true personality. That shy, timid, frightened pet may actually become a fun-loving clown when you bring him home. Many animals begin to blossom once they are in a loving home environment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n   Here\'s how to find the perfect pet for your family:\r\n</p>\r\n<h4>Plan ahead</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n   Bringing a new pet into your home is a lifelong responsibility. Don\'t rush into a decision. It may even require several visits to the shelter before you make a final commitment.\r\n</p>\r\n<h5>You can make the decision a bit easier if you narrow down some of your decisions:</h5>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n   <li>What type of dog or cat are you looking for?</li>\r\n   <li>Do you want a puppy or a kitten?</li>\r\n   <li>Would you prefer an adult dog or cat?</li>\r\n   <li>Would you consider giving a loving home to a senior pet or one with special needs?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>If you have very young children:</h5>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n   <li>Consider leaving them in the care of a friend or family member when you make your initial visit. Children can get overly excited and their enthusiasm can be intimidating for a dog or cat meeting them for the first time.</li>\r\n   <li>Once you have focused in on a particular dog or cat that is the time to take the kids along and introduce them to the animal in the shelter\'s hospitality room, or, in the case of a dog, outside in the exercise area.</li>\r\n   <li>Most shelters or rescues will not hold pets for you, so have your kids nearby if you anticipate you\'ll be adopting a pet the same day as your first visit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>How to assess an animal at a shelter</h4>\r\n<p>Most shelters will have kennel cards on each cage that provide basic information about the animal, including age, whether or not the pet is owner relinquished, any obvious health issues, and, sometimes, how the animal does with other animals. it\'s also important to try to assess for yourself the health, demeanor and personality of a potential pet:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"arham\">\r\n   <li>Does the animal appear healthy? Are his eyes clear or runny?

Once again, don\'t be deterred if he is a bit shy. Cats or kittens that are hiding or facing away from you may simply need a bit more socializing. You will have to determine if you have time at home to spend extra time working with the cat to help coax him out of his shell.</li>\r\n   <li>How does the dog or cat move and walk? Check for any signs of awkwardness.</li>\r\n   <li>Kittens or puppies are often kept together in their original litters. Check how the kitten or puppy that catches your attention reacts to his littermates.</li>\r\n   <li>How does the dog or cat respond if you approach the cage and wiggle your fingers?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Shelter volunteers are happy to answer all your questions. Often the volunteers have spent enough time around the animal to provide additional insight into what the pet likes or unique behaviours.</p>\r\n<h4>Assessing a pet\'s health</h4>\r\n<p>These days, shelters go to great lengths to ensure that their pets are well-groomed and free of fleas, ticks and ear mites. Many shelters also work with animal behaviourists who volunteer their time to ensure that pets are well socialized, as this gives them a better chance of overcoming the stresses of the shelter environment and ultimately of being adopted.</p>\r\n<p>Many animals that end up in shelters have had a rough time and may not have glossy coats as a result of being previously malnourished. Don\'t let this deter you. Proper food and a loving, stress-free home can often turn around a dull coat.</p>\r\n<h4>Animals with special needs</h4>\r\n<p>Many animals with physical disabilities, medical problems or behavioral issues end up in shelters, too. Caring for a special needs pet can be very rewarding experience. Before you undertake this extra responsibility, talk to your veterinarian about what is involved with the pet\'s care to ensure you can afford the additional expenses and time commitments you may encounter. Also, never undertake this responsibility unless there is someone at home full-time.</p>\r\n<h4>Get to know the animals</h4>\r\n<p>There may be several animals that get your attention at the shelter. Ask a volunteer to arrange for you to spend some time with each animal separately in one of the shelter\'s hospitality rooms.</p>\r\n<p>These private areas are often away from the shelter activity and noise and the one-on-one time gives you both a chance to interact. For animals that are stressed and cower in their cages, a visit will give them an opportunity to come out of their shell a little bit and slowly begin to react to you. Remember, be patient.</p>\r\n<p>If you think you have found the perfect dog or cat to become your newest family member, arrange for the shelter to put them on hold so you can arrange to bring your children to visit. It\'s important to explain to kids to sit quietly and observe and initiate games slowly. This gives the animal an opportunity to inspect them, too.</p>\r\n<h4>The paperwork</h4>\r\n<p>Once you have made your decision, the shelter will require you to fill out adoption forms, which can be lengthy. Expect questions about:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"arham\">\r\n   <li>Where do you live?</li>\r\n   <li>Do you have a suitable outdoor area for a dog? </li>\r\n   <li>For cats, expect the shelter to request that you guarantee in writing that the cat will have an indoor-only lifestyle. </li>\r\n   <li>The shelter also will want to know about other pets and people in the home. </li>\r\n   <li>Many shelters will require confirmation that all consenting adults in the home agree to the adoption. They are looking after the animal\'s best interests and ensuring the pet is going to a loving, forever home.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Adoption fees</h4>\r\n<p>Adoption fees vary from shelter to shelter. They cover the cost of any medical care the pet may have received as well as the spay/neuter operation, if not previously done, vaccinations and deworming.</p>\r\n<p class=\"padding-bottom-sm\">Another reason for an adoption fee is because shelters believe a monetary commitment helps people to underline the responsibility of pet parenting and the promise to give a pet a good home.</p>\r\n<h4>Home inspections</h4>\r\n<p>Many rescues will not release a pet into your care before they have made a home inspection to confirm it\'s a safe and clean environment. This is because they take entrusting a pet into your care very seriously and want the best situation for that pet to thrive and be safe.</p>\r\n<p>While adopting a pet is a commitment, it\'s also important to inquire about the shelter\'s return policy, just in case things don\'t work out.</p>\r\n<p>Most shelters provide you with as much information as they can about your new pet (you\'ll receive more if the pet was owner relinquished).

The tag should have your phone number, my name, and your name on it. Even if I have been micro chipped, having a visible tag can help bring me back to you if I get lost.</li>\r\n<li>I need to be updated on all of my shots. Believe me, I\'d rather skip those vaccines but they will keep me healthy and happy. </li>\r\n<li>Training should start immediately once you get the okay from my veterinarian. By establishing a routine of positive challenges, I won’t get bored, which means I won’t get into trouble in my new home. </li>\r\n<li>I love the new nutrition you are giving me. However, at the shelter where I lived, they fed me a different brand of kibble. Any change in my diet could upset my stomach, so please introduce me to it by mixing the two brands and slowly transitioning me onto my new yummy food. Also, I need some help with portion control: please don’t overfeed me or give me table scraps—even when I stare at you with adorable, pleading eyes.</li>\r\n<li>My water bowl needs to be changed each day to make sure my water is fresh and bacteria doesn’t start growing in my bowl.</li>\r\n<li>Potty training is just as important for me as it is for you, a consistent routine containing lots of positive praise when I am going at the right place at the right time will keep us both happy.</li>\r\n<li>I know you are busy. Can you spend quality time with me? Maybe we can toss a ball around or visit the dog park. It would be great for me if you create a schedule and try to stick to it. </li>\r\n<li>Please show me some patience. I am new to everything, and I have to learn to trust you.

Re-homing can be very stressful for both you and your pet.</p>\r\n<h2>Create a Flyer</h2>\r\n<p>Create a flyer or resume that you can show to potential pet parents. Take several photographs of your pet that show off their personality, such as portrait shots and cute photographs of your pet playing with toys, cuddling with you, enjoying the comforts of their home. Photographs that highlight interaction with family members will show that your pet has always been treated as a treasured member of the family.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s important to explain why she has to be re-homed. Describe the ideal type of new home you\'re looking for so you can replicate as closely as possible what she had with you. Remember that you are ultimately looking for a forever home; you don\'t want her to have her go through this process again.</p>\r\n<p>If your pet loves and interacts with other animals, spell out whether she likes both dogs and cats or prefers one to the other. Some pets prefer to be \"only fur kids.\" Also, make it known whether your pet likes to be around children or favors the company of adults. Senior pets are often a good fit for senior citizens.</p>\r\n<p>Outline her personality traits, her food likes and dislikes. When it comes to dogs, outline the type of exercise she is used to and her favorite games. Cats like to play too, so detail her favorite toys and if she is used to enjoying the view from a tall kitty condo or comfy bed. Companion animals also have specialized diets and unique play and exercise schedules that are important to communicate to the potential new pet parent.</p>\r\n<p>Don\'t forget to include your contact information on the flyer.</p>\r\n<h2>Share. Share. Share.</h2>\r\n<p>Once you have flyers, put them up as many places as possible, starting with your veterinarian\'s office. Coffee shops often have a notice board, as do pet stores, boarding facilities, shelters and grooming salons. Spread the word to your co-workers, family and friends and email everyone you think could possibly help. Post messages on social media sites and consider putting your pet on reputable websites that specialize in pet adoptions, like <a href=\"https://www.petfinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">petfinder.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If there is a local newspaper, place an advertisement to attract people in your area. Never advertise your pet to strangers as \"Free to a Good Home.\" Even if it is a nominal fee, you want to ensure that the person who takes your pet has the means to care for him.</p>\r\n<p>If your dog or cat is a purebred, consider contacting relevant breed rescue groups. They will understand your dog\'s or cat\'s innate characteristics and know what to look for in finding the right people and home environment for a particular breed.</p>\r\n<p>Only take your pet to a shelter as a last resort; many shelters are filled to capacity, meaning that animals are only kept a certain number of days before they are euthanized due to lack of space. Never simply abandon your pet or leave her to fend for herself. In addition to being inhumane, it\'s illegal. A domestic animal that has had the care, attention and reassurance of knowing there will be a daily food bowl is unable to survive for long on their own anywhere – whether you live in the city or out in the country.</p>\r\n<h2>What to Ask Potential Pet Parents</h2>\r\n<p>When someone contacts you, have a list of applicable questions ready to ask before you meet:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Do you currently have any pets or children?</li>\r\n<li>Have you had pets before? If so, what happened to them?</li>\r\n<li>Do you own your own home, or live where pets are allowed? Ask for proof in writing.</li>\r\n<li>Who is at home during the day?</li>\r\n<li>Will you take the pet for an annual wellness check and to a veterinarian at the first sign of a problem?</li>\r\n<li>What about grooming? Is this something you will do or have done professionally?</li>\r\n<li>Where will the pet sleep? </li>\r\n<li>Will the cat be kept indoors permanently and be rewarded with lots of toys and supplies?</li>\r\n<li>What type of exercise routines are you able to provide?</li>\r\n<li>Do you understand the financial implications sharing a home with a pet? Are you able to meet these obligations without incurring a hardship?</li>\r\n<li>Does anyone in your home have allergies?</li>\r\n<li>Does everyone in the family agree on adding this pet to your family?</li>\r\n<li>What would you plan to do if someone in the family developed allergies to the pet or if you had to move?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to let them know that you will take your pet back if it doesn\'t work out.</p>\r\n<h2>The Initial Meeting</h2>\r\n<p>If you feel confident after talking on the phone, arrange for the potential adopter to come and meet your pet in your home. It\'s very important to see how your pet reacts to the person and vice versa. You may have to arrange more than one visit, especially if the potential adopter has kids. You don\'t want to overwhelm your pet during the first meet-and-greet. If you can, visit their home, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to how they interact with your pet, and how your pet responds. If you\'re pet seems highly resistant, she may be trying to tell you something. Listen to your heart. If you have any doubt about any one thing, apply the old adage, <i>when in doubt, don\'t</i>. Keep looking. You will find the right pet parent for your pet.</p>\r\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Be prepared to provide your pet\'s new pet parent with all of her favorite toys and supplies, and include a few weeks\' of food, too. This will help your pet settle in more quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Be sure to include any special instructions, and advise them of anything unique about your pet (\"Princess likes to sleep in her bed on the floor at the foot of the bed\" or \"Georgia prefers her dry food mixed with 1 tablespoon of wet food\"). These tidbits will help your pet more easily adjust to her new home. If your pet has behavioral issues that you have been unable to resolve (or haven\'t tried to resolve), it\'s important to be honest. Often, with the right training, many behavioral issues can be rectified. And, Make sure to provide copies of all of your pet\'s veterinary records.</p>\r\n<h2>The Final Goodbye</h2>\r\n<p>When you do feel you have found the right pet parents for your pet, try and keep the transition as unemotional as possible. Don\'t forget to provide all of your pet\'s toys and supplies as well as food for at least one month. The change is going to be stressful enough and a change in diet can only make things worse.</p>\r\n<p>Stay in touch with the new pet parents to ensure everything is going smoothly. Provide them with your contact information (if you are moving) so that they can share information with you. Ask for photographs that show that she is settling in to her new environment and learning to love her new family.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-14 23:41:09', '2021-08-14 23:41:09'),
(6, 5, '<p>When adopting a pet, one choice you have to make is whether to adopt a puppy or kitten, an adult, or a senior. All shelter pets deserve loving homes, but senior pets are often overlooked. Animal shelters across the country are filled with healthy, active and loveable senior dogs and cats. Adopting a senior pet can be the best decision a person can make, especially since it can be a life-saving act for the pet. Shelters are overcrowded and, unfortunately, according to the American Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, older dogs are among the first to be euthanized if they aren\'t adopted in a timely manner. In addition to being a life saver, here are some other reasons why rescuing a senior pet can be a fantastic decision:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>They provide unconditional love.</strong> Many older dogs and cats were once owned and loved by someone, but for whatever reason, they were relinquished to a shelter. In most cases, relinquishment is due to the sudden death of an owner, divorce, a move, loss of a job, etc. and has nothing to do with the pets\' behavior. Senior pets will love their new family just as much as a puppy or kitten would. They are incredibly resilient and have the ability to bond with their new family in just a matter of days, if not instantly. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Senior pets are like an open book.</strong> When choosing an older pet, new owners will have a pretty good understanding of what they\'re getting since the pet\'s physical traits and temperament will be established. Also, most shelters will know if the pet has any prior medical or special needs issues, so pet parents can be prepared right off the bat.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Senior pets are ideal for first time pet parents</strong> who may not have the time necessary to train, socialize, and exercise a young or adolescent puppy properly. On most occasions, senior pets are already housetrained, know basic obedience commands and are comfortable being left alone at home.</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-14 23:44:59', '2021-08-14 23:44:59'),
(7, 9, '<p>Adopting a pet to grow your family is one of the best ways for an animal lover to help spread their love. Luckily, there are a number of resources for finding your perfect pet match. Begin by learning about the various adoption options to determine which ones are most likely to result in the outcome you hope to achieve.</p>\r\n<h2>Where to adopt a dog or cat</h2>\r\n<p>Pet adoption can occur in a number of different ways, and taking the time to understand how the process works for each one can help you along the way. Adoption options include:<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Animal Shelters and Humane Societies</strong></p>\r\n<p>The world is too full of dogs and cats waiting for a home and many end up at local shelters or humane societies. While many pets can live out the rest of their lives in these locations, some shelters are overcrowded and can only provide temporary homes for a certain number of days. That’s why an animal shelter or humane society is a great place to start your search for a pet.&nbsp; If there’s one in your area, plan a visit. You can meet adoptable animals and learn about volunteer opportunities and special adoption events. A current resident might be just what you’re looking for.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Shelters and humane societies often include an adoption fee that can range anywhere from $50 up to a few hundred dollars or more, but that usually includes the cost of a spay or neuter and shots. Before taking a pet home, you may be asked to answer questions or fill out paperwork to provide them with more insight into your lifestyle, time the pet will spend alone most days, the type of home/yard you have, additional pets you might have, etc. Some shelters require a home visit to ensure you’ve properly pet-proofed and are set up for your new family member’s arrival. For specific details about the process your local shelter or society follows, give them a call and ask.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Breed Rescue Groups</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you’re in the market for a specific breed, you may want to start your search with a breed enthusiast group or breed-specific rescue association. Before heading down this route, though, do your research to learn if the temperament and care requirements of the breed you’re interested in match your specific wants and lifestyle.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Shelters are usually aware of local breed rescues and can provide referrals. Potential dog parents can also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/akc-rescue-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Kennel Club Rescue Network</a>, while <a href=\"https://tica.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The International Cat Association</a> is a good resource for would-be cat parents. Breed rescue groups often use foster pet parents to take care of animals until they find a home. Because they often spend a lot of time with the animals they care for, foster pet parents are particularly well qualified to tell you about the personality and characteristics of a dog or cat you may be interested in adopting. Their insights can help ease the transition when you bring your new pet home. Adopting through a breed rescue group is similar to working with a shelter, in that the organization will take steps to ensure you are the right match for the pet and that your home offers a suitable environment for that pet. Again, how much you pay to adopt from a breed rescue can vary from $0 on up to $250 or more. Since each breed and group is different, be sure to talk with the administrator about the process, fees and specifics up front so they don’t&nbsp; come as a surprise when your perfect pet comes along.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Work with Your Veterinarian</strong></p>\r\n<p>Veterinarians can be a wealth of knowledge about adoption opportunities in your area, especially when it comes to helping rehome patients whose parents can no longer care for them. Veterinary technicians or volunteers at vet offices, who may also volunteer at shelters or help out as foster pet parents, may be able to point you in the right direction as well. If your veterinarian’s office has a bulletin board, you can start there, or ask at the reception desk.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> The process of adopting through your veterinarian—as well as what you end up paying—will vary widely based on the circumstance. For example, if your veterinarian happens to know an elderly pet parent who needs to find a new loving home for the dog they can no longer care for, that adoption process could be fairly straightforward and free. If, on the other hand, your veterinarian sets you up with a shelter or breed-specific rescue group, you’ll likely go through their regular process and pay something within the fee range mentioned above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Pet Adoption Websites</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pet adoption websites—like <a href=\"https://www.adoptapet.com/\">adoptapet.com</a> or the adopt a pet feature on <a href=\"https://www.petcolove.org/put-your-love-into-action/learn-about-adoption/search-adoptable-pets/\">petcolove.org</a>—are gaining in popularity, and they can be a great way to start your adoption search from the comfort of your own home. Most of these sites help draw in rescue options that are available at your local shelters or with rescue groups, as well as animals currently residing with foster pet parents. These sites can be an asset if you’re looking for a pet with specific attributes, since you can often search by breed, age and gender, among other factors.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> These sites often only act as aggregators for shelters or other adoption organizations in your area. Once you click on a pet you’re interested in, you’ll likely be taken to that shelter or rescue’s website for more information or to fill out an email interest sheet. After that, the process would follow the traditional ones for a shelter or breed-specific rescue group listed above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Friends and Family</strong></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps one of the easiest ways to start your adoption search is by getting the word out to friends and family that you’re looking to adopt a pet. Many different factors contribute to people <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/adoption-rescue/how-to-re-home-your-pet.html\">giving up their beloved pets</a>, and most are very grateful when a new loving home comes along quickly. Plus, if you end up adopting through someone you know, you have the added benefit of being able to contact them with any questions, as well as potentially keep some of the supplies that the pet is already used to.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Adopting a pet from a friend or family member could be easier than going through a shelter or breeder, but you’ll still want to make sure you do your due diligence. For example, before taking home any pet, be sure to ask about shot, health and microchip records and whether the animal is spayed or neutered, and ask for copies of any veterinary records so you can stay on top of or get ahead of health issues.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Petco Adoption Events</strong></p>\r\n<p>Petco makes it easy to find your new furry family member by allowing you to meet adoptable pets at your local store. Cats are available for adoption in certain stores and dog adoption events occur routinely with rescue partners (call your <a href=\"https://stores.petco.com/\">local Petco for more details</a>).</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> The Petco Foundation hosts adoption events nationwide every month where prospective pet parents can come in to meet different animals available for adoption. Be prepared to answer questions about your lifestyle, other pets and overall availability. You’ll likely fill out a form with some information and maybe even have a house visit. Again, since adoptions are only facilitated by Petco and the Petco Foundation, the process is usually carried out and finalized by a rescue group or shelter that will adhere to their standard procedures.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Whatever route you decide to take to adopt, know that adopting a pet is a big responsibility, as well as a wonderful way to help a deserving animal find a forever home. When you do finally adopt, Petco has <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore\">all the supplies</a> you need to help keep your new family member happy and healthy. </p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-15 00:00:29', '2021-08-15 00:00:29'),
(8, 10, '<p>Welcoming a dog into your home is a big responsibility and should only be undertaken if you accept that you are signing up for a lifelong commitment. However, life doesn’t always go as planned, and there may come a time when rehoming must be considered.</p>\r\n<p>People think about rehoming their dogs for a number of reasons—behavior issues, unforeseen costs and everything in between—but it’s important to exhaust every option to find a solution before giving up. Rehoming a dog is stressful for the pet, can put increased demand on potentially already overcrowded shelters and is likely to have emotional consequences for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Why people rehome their dogs</h2>\r\n<p>The first few months with a dog can be stressful—especially if you’re a first-time pet parent but no matter what the problem, there is often a solution. It might not always be easy, but like all good things in life, it’s worth giving it your all before you give in. A few of the more common reasons people rehome their dogs—as well as some steps to take before doing so—include:</p>\r\n<h3>Lack of time</h3>\r\n<p>If you’ve never had a pet before, the amount of time you need to spend to keep your dog happy and healthy might surprise you, especially if the dog is young. Additionally, if you begin pet parenthood while working from home and then experience a schedule change, your available time with your dog might&nbsp; diminish. Although one-on-one time is important for bonding, a schedule change might just require a different solution to keep your dog engaged.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What to try:</strong> To keep your dog busy at home while you’re away, try <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/dog/dog-toys/interactive-dog-toys\">interactive toys</a> that stimulate their mind and keep them entertained for a while. Positive <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/s/petco-dog-training\">reinforcement-based training</a> can help to reinforce desired behaviors, build confidence and curb unwanted behaviors. If you have a safe, fenced-in yard, a <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/dog/dog-gates-doors-and-pens/dog-doors-and-dog-flaps\">doggy door</a> can provide your pup with outdoor access to explore and get some fresh air. If you’re away for hours at a time, consider doggy day care where your pup can socialize with other dogs and humans. Bonus—most pups come home from day care very tired from a day of fun! Do your research to find the right match for your dog and ensure they’re well enough behaved to pass the temperament tests most locations require. While walks before and after work can help most dogs keep active, if you’re having trouble getting home in time or want to let your pup out for some mid-day activity, try hiring a <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/c/dog-walking\">dog walker</a> to give your pup a little activity (and a potty break).</p>\r\n<h3>A move</h3>\r\n<p>Moving homes is stressful enough without taking a pet into consideration. Additionally, long-distance moves make some people feel that their dog would be happier staying put. But with some forethought and planning, there are few reasons that your pup can’t come with you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What to try:</strong> When planning your move, be sure to ask about pet restrictions and only consider places that will accept your pet. If management at a potential rental seems hesitant about allowing your dog, ask about their concerns. Offering to pay an extra deposit or showing training records or other health records may help alleviate fears about the temperament or health status of your pet.</p>\r\n<p>If your dog is underfoot while you’re trying to pack and prepare for a move, consider having them stay with a close friend or relative for a day or two so you can focus your attention on what needs to get done. When moving day arrives, you’ll need to be prepared. A <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/you-and-me-classic-dog-kennel\">dog kennel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/good2go-take-out-collapsible-pet-travel-bowl\">travel pet bowls</a> and/or <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/precision-pet-universal-vehicle-pet-barrier\">vehicle pet barriers</a> make things easier and safer for car travel, while <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/dog/dog-health-and-wellness/dog-calming-aids\">dog calming aids</a> like treats and collars can help make the ride smooth for your pet no matter what form of transportation your move requires.</p>\r\n<p>While moving far away may seem like a stressful experience on your pet, consider the alternative—them being left without their family and needing to find a new one. While the move itself may be difficult for everyone, planning long moves via car with your pet in mind and taking plenty of breaks may actually result in some fun memories. For even longer moves, you may need to research if there are quarantine requirements at your final destination or consult specialized pet transport companies to ensure your pet can stay safe and reunite with your family later on.</p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral issues</h3>\r\n<p>Behavioral issues are a common reason people cite when giving up their pet. Although it can be nerve-wracking to have to deal with these types of issues, it’s important to realize that you don’t have to do so alone.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What to try:</strong> There are a number of expert options to help you deal with whatever behavioral issues your dog might be having. Putting your dog through <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/s/petco-dog-training\">training classes</a> or meeting with a pet behaviorist is a great start to address your particular concerns. If you’re not sure where to start, your veterinarian can often be a good resource for finding options in your area.</p>\r\n<h3>Aggression</h3>\r\n<p>Aggression is a more serious behavioral issue where giving up can seem like the easiest option. However, when proactive steps are taken, your dog’s behavior can often be de-escalated so that they can stay with you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What to try:</strong> It’s essential to address aggression as soon as you notice it. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to treat the issue. If your dog is acting out in an aggressive way, meet with your veterinarian or pet behaviorist immediately to determine the best course of action for your specific pet.</p>\r\n<h3>The cost of your pet</h3>\r\n<p>Having a pet can be expensive, especially if you have to deal with the cost of an unexpected health issue or training. Even so, there are some things you can do to help curb the costs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you can try:</strong> Monthly pet insurance premiums are often relatively inexpensive and can be a good way to help mitigate future health costs. Your local shelter might also be able to help point you in the direction of other organizations in your area that offer low-cost options for things like spay and neuter services. Vaccination clinics and affordable vet services can also be found through Petco’s <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/s/veterinary-services\">veterinary services network</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Health concerns</h3>\r\n<p>Dealing with ongoing health concerns not only affects your budget but can also be emotionally taxing. However, giving up on your pet, especially when they need you most is not the answer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you can try:</strong> In addition to some of the options listed above, look for online support groups or ask your veterinarian about local resources for pets with similar issues to your own. The support of others may help you as you help your pet. And remember that their less than optimal health doesn’t take away from the unconditional love they give you!</p>\r\n<h3>A new baby</h3>\r\n<p>Bringing a baby home is a wonderful time for a family, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. Before deciding that handling a baby and a puppy at the same time is too much, try these easy steps.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you can try:</strong> To start, training and early socialization is essential to ensure dogs know how to handle themselves around other people. It’s also key to begin to <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/behavior-training/Helping-Your-Dog-Adjust-When-Bringing-Your-Baby-Home.html\">introduce them to the change</a> that’s about to occur. As you bring in new baby gear, allow your dog to smell some of the furniture and toys (wash before giving back to baby!). As your nursery is finalized, let your dog explore the space so they become used to the new norm. Before you introduce your dog to your baby, offer them the scent of a used blanket.</p>\r\n<p>As you’re buying new gear for your baby, don’t forget your pup! You can assume that when baby comes home you’ll be busy and exhausted, so load up on mentally stimulating <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/dog/dog-toys/interactive-dog-toys\">interactive toys</a> for your dog and consider setting up a dog walker who can help ensure your dog gets the exercise they need to stay healthy and to tire them out.</p>\r\n<h3>Allergies</h3>\r\n<p>If you’re allergic to your dog, or someone in your household develops allergies, it can be hard to make it through the day. All hope is not lost, though.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you can try:</strong> Speak with your doctor immediately about relieving dog allergies. Over-the-counter medications may be all the relief you’ll need, depending on your allergy’s severity, but your doctor can also prescribe medications more specific to your needs. A specialized vacuum meant to capture pet hair and keeping your dog on a strict and <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/s/dog-grooming\">proper grooming schedule</a> can help as well.</p>\r\n<h2>Rehoming your dog properly</h2>\r\n<p>When you’ve tried your best and exhausted all the alternatives, sometimes rehoming is the only solution. If you’re going to head down this road, it’s important to do it the right way so that you know your dog will be properly taken care of. If you can’t find someone in your own life who is responsible and loving and would be interested in taking in your pet, there are a number of ways to go about finding a loving home, including asking your veterinarian and local shelter for advice.</p>\r\n<p>If you’ll be finding a new home for your pet yourself, <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/adoption-rescue/how-to-re-home-your-pet.html\">be sure to do it the right way</a>, by asking the proper questions, knowing what to expect in your first meeting and following up with the appropriate steps.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-15 00:03:11', '2021-08-15 00:03:11');

(9, 6, '<p>Looking for a feline friend? Start your search with a shelter or other reputable animal welfare organization. When you adopt an animal, you save two lives: the life of the animal you adopted and the life of the animal you just made room for in the shelter.</p>\r\n<p>To help ensure a lasting relationship with your new kitty confidante, you’ll need to choose the right cat for your lifestyle. It’s important to know the personality traits you are looking for in a cat before you visit an animal shelter or rescue group. Here are some things to consider:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Expenses:</strong> Can you afford a cat? According to the ASPCA, current recurring yearly costs for items such as food, litter, medical expenses, insurance, toys, treats, etc. are expected to be approximately $670/year, while an initial outlay for items such as spaying/neutering, other medical expenses, collar, litter box, scratching post and carrier could be about $365 and up.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that pets adopted from shelters and rescue groups typically cost less than pets purchased or even acquired for free. Once you add in the cost of vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, microchip, dewormer, and other \"extras\" that are often included in your adoption fee, you\'ll probably be surprised what a bargain an adopted pet really is!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Personality/Fit:</strong> Do you want a cuddly lap cat or one that’s playful and active? Do you have the time to exercise and play with your cat? One of the most common mistakes people make when adopting is choosing a cat based on his looks rather than his personality. For instance, if you have children or other pets, it is important to know if the cat you’re considering adopting will get along well with them. Shelter volunteers and staff interact with the cats daily so ask for their opinions to help you make an informed decision. In addition, most shelters and rescue groups conduct a thorough behavioral analysis of each pet to ensure that they will be the right fit for your family, dramatically improving the chances that your new pet will fit right in.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Purebred or Mix:</strong> Think you want a purebred? You’d be surprised how many purebred cats are available in shelters. You also can check with your local cat fanciers club to find the names and numbers of local cat breed rescue groups that are dedicated to the breed you’re looking for. Be sure to do a bit of research on breed personalities, dispositions and hereditary traits to help find the breed best suited for your lifestyle. For example, some breeds are known jumpers, which may not work if you have a special china collection on display. Others are known for their abilities to get into even the most contained cabinet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cat or Kitten:</strong> We all know how cute kittens are. They can be lots of fun but they require a lot of your time and supervision. If you do decide that a kitten is right for your family, consider adopting two together.

Adoption options include:<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Animal Shelters and Humane Societies</strong></p>\r\n<p>The world is too full of dogs and cats waiting for a home and many end up at local shelters or humane societies. While many pets can live out the rest of their lives in these locations, some shelters are overcrowded and can only provide temporary homes for a certain number of days. That’s why an animal shelter or humane society is a great place to start your search for a pet.&nbsp; If there’s one in your area, plan a visit. You can meet adoptable animals and learn about volunteer opportunities and special adoption events. A current resident might be just what you’re looking for.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Shelters and humane societies often include an adoption fee that can range anywhere from $50 up to a few hundred dollars or more, but that usually includes the cost of a spay or neuter and shots. Before taking a pet home, you may be asked to answer questions or fill out paperwork to provide them with more insight into your lifestyle, time the pet will spend alone most days, the type of home/yard you have, additional pets you might have, etc. Some shelters require a home visit to ensure you’ve properly pet-proofed and are set up for your new family member’s arrival. For specific details about the process your local shelter or society follows, give them a call and ask.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Breed Rescue Groups</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you’re in the market for a specific breed, you may want to start your search with a breed enthusiast group or breed-specific rescue association.

Breed rescue groups often use foster pet parents to take care of animals until they find a home. Because they often spend a lot of time with the animals they care for, foster pet parents are particularly well qualified to tell you about the personality and characteristics of a dog or cat you may be interested in adopting. Their insights can help ease the transition when you bring your new pet home. Adopting through a breed rescue group is similar to working with a shelter, in that the organization will take steps to ensure you are the right match for the pet and that your home offers a suitable environment for that pet. Again, how much you pay to adopt from a breed rescue can vary from $0 on up to $250 or more.

(11, 7, '<p>There are many reasons why you may need to re-home your cat. It\'s a drastic decision and one that should never be made on the spur of the moment. Often there are ways to work around re-homing and it\'s up to every responsible cat parent to attempt to resolve any situation before having to make this final and permanent choice.</p>\r\n<p>Here are the main reasons cats are re-homed.</p>\r\n<h2>Behavioral Issues</h2>\r\n<p>Behavioral issues and, in particular, litter box avoidance, is the primary reason that cats lose their homes and end up in shelters. Cats are very clean creatures and often the reason they avoid the litter box is because it\'s not being scooped on a daily basis. Also, in multi-cat households, there may be too few litter boxes to accommodate all the cats. The rule of thumb, according to the American Association of Feline Practitioners, is one litter box per cat, plus one. Litter boxes should be scooped daily and cleaned with warm, soapy water on a weekly basis.</p>\r\n<p>Cats often find themselves in a shelter for suddenly biting or scratching a family member, particularly young children. There may be reasons for such sudden acts of aggression. Children need to be taught to respect pets and similarly a cat needs to be trained to respect all members of the household. If a cat\'s tail is constantly being pulled, it will react to defend it itself. Further, they will react when they are punished or physically hurt. A cat behaviorist will be able to resolve such issues in a household.</p>\r\n<p>Scratching is a natural behavior for cats. In order to prevent them from scratching and destroying your furniture, place numerous cat scratchers in different parts of the home and train your cats to use them. Providing plenty of toys and regular playtime helps keep them occupied while also providing bonding time.</p>\r\n<h2>Babies and Cats</h2>\r\n<p>There is a common misperception that babies and cats can\'t co-exist in the household. This opinion is fueled by myths such as cats smother babies by sleeping on them and deliberately scratch them. But these are simply myths. Cats are curious creatures and behaviorists suggest if you allow them to sniff out a new baby\'s room prior to the baby\'s arrival, this makes them feel at ease and, as a result, they no longer have the need to “break and enter” into the baby\'s space.</p>\r\n<h2>Toxoplasmosis and Pregnant Women</h2>\r\n<p>One of the biggest concerns for pregnant women is contracting toxoplasmosis from cleaning cat feces in litter boxes. Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite found in cats that have eaten infected meat. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), women who test positive for toxoplasmosis don\'t pass it on to the fetus because they have the necessary antibodies in their systems to fight the condition.</p>\r\n<p>There\'s no reason to get rid of a cat because of a pregnancy. Instead, women should avoid direct contact with feline feces by getting someone else to clean the litter box. The alternative is to wear gloves and disinfect the box every time you change the litter.</p>\r\n<p>Although cat toxoplasmosis is associated with feline feces, it is also very easy to pick up the parasite by eating raw or partly cooked meat, especially pork, lamb or venison, or by touching your hands to your mouth after contact with raw or undercooked meat in the kitchen. Consequently, cats are often blamed unnecessarily.</p>\r\n<h2>Moving</h2>\r\n<p>Moving to a new home or re-locating to a different city or state often prompts pet parents not to take their pets with them. Often the reason given is that cats will automatically return to their former homes. This is simply not true. While it is always a good idea to make your cat an indoor-only pet, sometimes that is not possible. If that is the case, be sure to keep your cat inside for a couple of weeks before you move and confine her to one room in the new home for a week or so before slowly letting her out to roam and explore. Cats are often deemed independent, but, in fact, they like to be with their favorite people. Also, surround your cat with her familiar toys and bedding to help her settle in to her new home.</p>\r\n<h2>Landlord Restrictions</h2>\r\n<p>There are many rentals that do not allow pets. It\'s never a good idea to try to hide your cat from the landlord because you may find yourself in a situation where you are forced to re-home on very short notice. It\'s better to be upfront and offer to pay a larger pet deposit. Alternatively, there are now pet-friendly rental agencies, and by working with one, you know that your pet will be welcome.</p>\r\n<h2>The Cost</h2>\r\n<p>Often people who respond to advertisements that say “free to a good home” acquire their cat without seriously understanding the financial implications of pet parenting. Illness, unexpected expenses, or the loss of a job may change the financial position of the household. If you are in dire straits, there are organizations that will help you pay for food and veterinary care on a short-term basis until your situation improves.</p>\r\n<h2>Health Issues</h2>\r\n<p>Pets can develop serious health issues and necessary medications, treatments or surgeries can cost a lot of money that cannot be absorbed by the family budget. In such cases, re-homing is a better option than euthanizing your cat. There are also organizations that will help you pay for expensive surgeries, so research your options. Finally, it\'s a good idea to consider getting pet insurance as soon as you get your new pet to avoid such a dilemma.</p>\r\n<h2>No Homes for Litter Mates</h2>\r\n<p>Adopting a cat from a shelter will mean that the cat will have been spayed or neutered before being entrusted into your care. However, when cats have been acquired from family members, friends or acquaintances, this may not be the case. This can lead to the cat having several litters of kittens. Often there simply is no room in the home or the finances to see to the needs of additional felines in the household. Spaying and neutering household pets can eradicate this problem and generally help curb pet overpopulation. In addition, when pets in the household don\'t get along with one another a decision is often made to keep one and re-home the other. Behaviorists often suggest keeping cats in separate areas of the home so that both pets can co-exist peacefully. They can also provide valuable tips on proper introduction and socialization techniques which can help you break down the barrier within your home.</p>\r\n<h2>Lifestyle Changes or Allergies</h2>\r\n<p>There are a variety of lifestyle changes that result in a cat being re-homed, such as divorce, the death of a spouse or the loss of a job. Another typical scenario is when a cat parent gets married or moves in with someone who is highly allergic to cat hair or dander. Both children and adults can suddenly develop allergies to the family cat as well. Sometimes antihistamine medication taken short-term can help to resolve this issue.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the cats you find in shelters today are there because their families had to relinquish them for many of these reasons. If you can spare re-homing a pet, you\'re helping a pet that\'s already at the shelter find her forever home.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-15 00:14:59', '2021-08-15 00:14:59'),
(12, 11, '<p>There are times when families are faced with insurmountable financial or personal hardships and find themselves in the heart-breaking situation of having to find a new home for their beloved furry, scaly or feathered family member. Re-homing can be very stressful for both you and your pet.</p>\r\n<h2>Create a Flyer</h2>\r\n<p>Create a flyer or resume that you can show to potential pet parents. Take several photographs of your pet that show off their personality, such as portrait shots and cute photographs of your pet playing with toys, cuddling with you, enjoying the comforts of their home. Photographs that highlight interaction with family members will show that your pet has always been treated as a treasured member of the family.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s important to explain why she has to be re-homed. Describe the ideal type of new home you\'re looking for so you can replicate as closely as possible what she had with you. Remember that you are ultimately looking for a forever home; you don\'t want her to have her go through this process again.</p>\r\n<p>If your pet loves and interacts with other animals, spell out whether she likes both dogs and cats or prefers one to the other. Some pets prefer to be \"only fur kids.\" Also, make it known whether your pet likes to be around children or favors the company of adults. Senior pets are often a good fit for senior citizens.</p>\r\n<p>Outline her personality traits, her food likes and dislikes. When it comes to dogs, outline the type of exercise she is used to and her favorite games. Cats like to play too, so detail her favorite toys and if she is used to enjoying the view from a tall kitty condo or comfy bed. Companion animals also have specialized diets and unique play and exercise schedules that are important to communicate to the potential new pet parent.</p>\r\n<p>Don\'t forget to include your contact information on the flyer.</p>\r\n<h2>Share. Share. Share.</h2>\r\n<p>Once you have flyers, put them up as many places as possible, starting with your veterinarian\'s office. Coffee shops often have a notice board, as do pet stores, boarding facilities, shelters and grooming salons. Spread the word to your co-workers, family and friends and email everyone you think could possibly help. Post messages on social media sites and consider putting your pet on reputable websites that specialize in pet adoptions, like <a href=\"https://www.petfinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">petfinder.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If there is a local newspaper, place an advertisement to attract people in your area. Never advertise your pet to strangers as \"Free to a Good Home.\" Even if it is a nominal fee, you want to ensure that the person who takes your pet has the means to care for him.</p>\r\n<p>If your dog or cat is a purebred, consider contacting relevant breed rescue groups. They will understand your dog\'s or cat\'s innate characteristics and know what to look for in finding the right people and home environment for a particular breed.</p>\r\n<p>Only take your pet to a shelter as a last resort; many shelters are filled to capacity, meaning that animals are only kept a certain number of days before they are euthanized due to lack of space. Never simply abandon your pet or leave her to fend for herself. In addition to being inhumane, it\'s illegal. A domestic animal that has had the care, attention and reassurance of knowing there will be a daily food bowl is unable to survive for long on their own anywhere – whether you live in the city or out in the country.</p>\r\n<h2>What to Ask Potential Pet Parents</h2>\r\n<p>When someone contacts you, have a list of applicable questions ready to ask before you meet:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Do you currently have any pets or children?</li>\r\n<li>Have you had pets before? If so, what happened to them?</li>\r\n<li>Do you own your own home, or live where pets are allowed? Ask for proof in writing.</li>\r\n<li>Who is at home during the day?</li>\r\n<li>Will you take the pet for an annual wellness check and to a veterinarian at the first sign of a problem?</li>\r\n<li>What about grooming? Is this something you will do or have done professionally?</li>\r\n<li>Where will the pet sleep? </li>\r\n<li>Will the cat be kept indoors permanently and be rewarded with lots of toys and supplies?</li>\r\n<li>What type of exercise routines are you able to provide?</li>\r\n<li>Do you understand the financial implications sharing a home with a pet? Are you able to meet these obligations without incurring a hardship?</li>\r\n<li>Does anyone in your home have allergies?</li>\r\n<li>Does everyone in the family agree on adding this pet to your family?</li>\r\n<li>What would you plan to do if someone in the family developed allergies to the pet or if you had to move?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to let them know that you will take your pet back if it doesn\'t work out.</p>\r\n<h2>The Initial Meeting</h2>\r\n<p>If you feel confident after talking on the phone, arrange for the potential adopter to come and meet your pet in your home. It\'s very important to see how your pet reacts to the person and vice versa. You may have to arrange more than one visit, especially if the potential adopter has kids. You don\'t want to overwhelm your pet during the first meet-and-greet. If you can, visit their home, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to how they interact with your pet, and how your pet responds. If you\'re pet seems highly resistant, she may be trying to tell you something. Listen to your heart. If you have any doubt about any one thing, apply the old adage, <i>when in doubt, don\'t</i>. Keep looking. You will find the right pet parent for your pet.</p>\r\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\r\n<p>Be prepared to provide your pet\'s new pet parent with all of her favorite toys and supplies, and include a few weeks\' of food, too. This will help your pet settle in more quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Be sure to include any special instructions, and advise them of anything unique about your pet (\"Princess likes to sleep in her bed on the floor at the foot of the bed\" or \"Georgia prefers her dry food mixed with 1 tablespoon of wet food\"). These tidbits will help your pet more easily adjust to her new home. If your pet has behavioral issues that you have been unable to resolve (or haven\'t tried to resolve), it\'s important to be honest. Often, with the right training, many behavioral issues can be rectified. And, Make sure to provide copies of all of your pet\'s veterinary records.</p>\r\n<h2>The Final Goodbye</h2>\r\n<p>When you do feel you have found the right pet parents for your pet, try and keep the transition as unemotional as possible. Don\'t forget to provide all of your pet\'s toys and supplies as well as food for at least one month. The change is going to be stressful enough and a change in diet can only make things worse.</p>\r\n<p>Stay in touch with the new pet parents to ensure everything is going smoothly. Provide them with your contact information (if you are moving) so that they can share information with you. Ask for photographs that show that she is settling in to her new environment and learning to love her new family.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-15 00:24:31', '2021-08-15 00:24:31'),

(14, 12, '<p>When adopting a pet, one choice you have to make is whether to adopt a puppy or kitten, an adult, or a senior. All shelter pets deserve loving homes, but senior pets are often overlooked. Animal shelters across the country are filled with healthy, active and loveable senior dogs and cats. Adopting a senior pet can be the best decision a person can make, especially since it can be a life-saving act for the pet. Shelters are overcrowded and, unfortunately, according to the American Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, older dogs are among the first to be euthanized if they aren\'t adopted in a timely manner. In addition to being a life saver, here are some other reasons why rescuing a senior pet can be a fantastic decision:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>They provide unconditional love.</strong> Many older dogs and cats were once owned and loved by someone, but for whatever reason, they were relinquished to a shelter. In most cases, relinquishment is due to the sudden death of an owner, divorce, a move, loss of a job, etc. and has nothing to do with the pets\' behavior. Senior pets will love their new family just as much as a puppy or kitten would. They are incredibly resilient and have the ability to bond with their new family in just a matter of days, if not instantly. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Senior pets are like an open book.</strong> When choosing an older pet, new owners will have a pretty good understanding of what they\'re getting since the pet\'s physical traits and temperament will be established. Also, most shelters will know if the pet has any prior medical or special needs issues, so pet parents can be prepared right off the bat.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Senior pets are ideal for first time pet parents</strong> who may not have the time necessary to train, socialize, and exercise a young or adolescent puppy properly. On most occasions, senior pets are already housetrained, know basic obedience commands and are comfortable being left alone at home.</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-15 00:29:33', '2021-08-15 00:29:33'),
(15, 13, '<p>Adopting a pet to grow your family is one of the best ways for an animal lover to help spread their love. Luckily, there are a number of resources for finding your perfect pet match. Begin by learning about the various adoption options to determine which ones are most likely to result in the outcome you hope to achieve.</p>\r\n<h2>Where to adopt a dog or cat</h2>\r\n<p>Pet adoption can occur in a number of different ways, and taking the time to understand how the process works for each one can help you along the way. Adoption options include:<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Animal Shelters and Humane Societies</strong></p>\r\n<p>The world is too full of dogs and cats waiting for a home and many end up at local shelters or humane societies. While many pets can live out the rest of their lives in these locations, some shelters are overcrowded and can only provide temporary homes for a certain number of days. That’s why an animal shelter or humane society is a great place to start your search for a pet.&nbsp; If there’s one in your area, plan a visit. You can meet adoptable animals and learn about volunteer opportunities and special adoption events. A current resident might be just what you’re looking for.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Shelters and humane societies often include an adoption fee that can range anywhere from $50 up to a few hundred dollars or more, but that usually includes the cost of a spay or neuter and shots. Before taking a pet home, you may be asked to answer questions or fill out paperwork to provide them with more insight into your lifestyle, time the pet will spend alone most days, the type of home/yard you have, additional pets you might have, etc. Some shelters require a home visit to ensure you’ve properly pet-proofed and are set up for your new family member’s arrival. For specific details about the process your local shelter or society follows, give them a call and ask.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Breed Rescue Groups</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you’re in the market for a specific breed, you may want to start your search with a breed enthusiast group or breed-specific rescue association. Before heading down this route, though, do your research to learn if the temperament and care requirements of the breed you’re interested in match your specific wants and lifestyle.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Shelters are usually aware of local breed rescues and can provide referrals. Potential dog parents can also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/akc-rescue-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Kennel Club Rescue Network</a>, while <a href=\"https://tica.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The International Cat Association</a> is a good resource for would-be cat parents. Breed rescue groups often use foster pet parents to take care of animals until they find a home. Because they often spend a lot of time with the animals they care for, foster pet parents are particularly well qualified to tell you about the personality and characteristics of a dog or cat you may be interested in adopting. Their insights can help ease the transition when you bring your new pet home. Adopting through a breed rescue group is similar to working with a shelter, in that the organization will take steps to ensure you are the right match for the pet and that your home offers a suitable environment for that pet. Again, how much you pay to adopt from a breed rescue can vary from $0 on up to $250 or more. Since each breed and group is different, be sure to talk with the administrator about the process, fees and specifics up front so they don’t&nbsp; come as a surprise when your perfect pet comes along.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Work with Your Veterinarian</strong></p>\r\n<p>Veterinarians can be a wealth of knowledge about adoption opportunities in your area, especially when it comes to helping rehome patients whose parents can no longer care for them. Veterinary technicians or volunteers at vet offices, who may also volunteer at shelters or help out as foster pet parents, may be able to point you in the right direction as well. If your veterinarian’s office has a bulletin board, you can start there, or ask at the reception desk.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> The process of adopting through your veterinarian—as well as what you end up paying—will vary widely based on the circumstance. For example, if your veterinarian happens to know an elderly pet parent who needs to find a new loving home for the dog they can no longer care for, that adoption process could be fairly straightforward and free. If, on the other hand, your veterinarian sets you up with a shelter or breed-specific rescue group, you’ll likely go through their regular process and pay something within the fee range mentioned above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Pet Adoption Websites</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pet adoption websites—like <a href=\"https://www.adoptapet.com/\">adoptapet.com</a> or the adopt a pet feature on are gaining in popularity, and they can be a great way to start your adoption search from the comfort of your own home. Most of these sites help draw in rescue options that are available at your local shelters or with rescue groups, as well as animals currently residing with foster pet parents. These sites can be an asset if you’re looking for a pet with specific attributes, since you can often search by breed, age and gender, among other factors.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> These sites often only act as aggregators for shelters or other adoption organizations in your area. Once you click on a pet you’re interested in, you’ll likely be taken to that shelter or rescue’s website for more information or to fill out an email interest sheet. After that, the process would follow the traditional ones for a shelter or breed-specific rescue group listed above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Friends and Family</strong></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps one of the easiest ways to start your adoption search is by getting the word out to friends and family that you’re looking to adopt a pet. Many different factors contribute to people <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/adoption-rescue/how-to-re-home-your-pet.html\">giving up their beloved pets</a>, and most are very grateful when a new loving home comes along quickly. Plus, if you end up adopting through someone you know, you have the added benefit of being able to contact them with any questions, as well as potentially keep some of the supplies that the pet is already used to.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Adopting a pet from a friend or family member could be easier than going through a shelter or breeder, but you’ll still want to make sure you do your due diligence. For example, before taking home any pet, be sure to ask about shot, health and microchip records and whether the animal is spayed or neutered, and ask for copies of any veterinary records so you can stay on top of or get ahead of health issues.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>MPMP Adoption Events</strong></p>\r\n<p>MPMP makes it easy to find your new furry family member by allowing you to meet adoptable pets at your local store. Cats are available for adoption in certain stores and dog adoption events occur routinely with rescue partners .</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> The MPMP Foundation hosts adoption events nationwide every month where prospective pet parents can come in to meet different animals available for adoption. Be prepared to answer questions about your lifestyle, other pets and overall availability. You’ll likely fill out a form with some information and maybe even have a house visit. Again, since adoptions are only facilitated by MPMP and the MPMP Foundation, the process is usually carried out and finalized by a rescue group or shelter that will adhere to their standard procedures.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Whatever route you decide to take to adopt, know that adopting a pet is a big responsibility, as well as a wonderful way to help a deserving animal find a forever home. When you do finally adopt, MPMP has <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore\">all the supplies</a> you need to help keep your new family member happy and healthy. </p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-15 00:30:56', '2021-10-14 14:53:47');

(16, 14, '<p>You\'ve decided to get a <a href=\"/shop/en/petcostore/category/bird/pet-birds\">pet bird</a>—a new feathered companion for yourself, your family and your home. Now it\'s time to choose one. There are a number of factors to consider before you adopt or purchase a bird. These factors and the particular traits different types of pet birds have, will help you determine which is the best pet bird for your family before you bring them home.</p>\r\n<p>When you’re ready to learn more about if a pet bird is right for your family and the best type of bird to welcome home for your particular situation, keep in mind the questions below.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the time commitment for a pet bird?</h2>\r\n<p>This is probably the most important question. Birds are intelligent, playful and, most important, social animals. Are you ready to commit to the time you will need to interact with your bird? When they first come home with you, getting your <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/PetcoContentDisplayView?catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;path=/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/new-pet/how-to-socialize-your-pet-bird.html\">bird comfortable and socialized</a> within their new environment takes dedication – and days – to achieve. And, the work doesn’t stop there! Birds need continual stimulation in their habitats and some types of pet birds can become frustrated or bored if they are not allowed time out of their habitat every day for interaction. You should set aside a specific time for you and your bird to interact, play with <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/bird/toys-for-birds\">toys</a> and even work on teaching them different tricks or cues.</p>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/Petco-How-to-Choose-the-Right-Pet-Bird_600x400-C.v4\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"bird social interaction\">\r\n<p>Habitat cleaning is also an important task that requires dedicated time from pet parents. While it may seem like a chore, it is one that must be done on a regular basis. The habitat structure, <a href=\"/shop/en/petcostore/category/bird/litter-and-liners-for-birds\">substrate (or habitat liner)</a>, <a href=\"/shop/en/petcostore/category/bird/bird-perches-swings-and-playstands\">perches</a>, dishes, toys and grates should be cleaned out at least weekly. Food and water dishes should be cleaned and refreshed daily as well.</p>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/Petco-How-to-Choose-the-Right-Pet-Bird_600x400-D.v4\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"bird cage care\">\r\n<p>It is also important to consider the time commitment you will have with your bird in a different way. Birds are very long-lived and will be lifelong companions. For example, a cockatiel can live up to 25 years, an Amazon or an African grey up 60 years. There are documented cases of some birds living to be 100 years old! Can you commit to that? It\'s not unusual for birds to be passed to the next generation, so preparing for that possibility is important.</p>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/Petco-How-to-Choose-the-Right-Pet-Bird_600x400-B.v4\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"bird lifespan\">\r\n<h2>What personality traits do pet birds have?</h2>\r\n<p>Birds tend to have distinct personalities. Some species attach themselves to one family member and shower that person with all their devotion. That person may or may not be the one who loves and feeds them the most. Other birds will divide their love among all family members equally. Decide if you want a tame bird that will cuddle with you while you relax at night or if you prefer a bird that remains in his habitat most of the time. Some species prefer minimal to no handling, while others crave attention to the point that they will become upset if they don\'t receive it. Be sure to take that into consideration.</p>\r\n<h3>Are you ready for a messy roommate?</h3>\r\n<p>All birds make a mess. Careful planning of the habitat and surrounding area can make things neater and easier to clean. Even a potty-trained bird has accidents. And, birds also produce dander. Remember, sharing a home with a bird can be like having a two-year-old-forever.</p>\r\n<h3>How chatty is your ideal pet bird?</h3>\r\n<p>Different bird species have different \"chatters\" and noise levels. Some, like budgies, are known to chatter, while cockatiels can whistle (sometimes quite loudly) And if you’ve ever been around a macaw, you know that some can get quite loud. If you\'re looking for a quite bird, finches or female canaries may be a good option.</p>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/Petco-How-to-Choose-the-Right-Pet-Bird_600x400-G.v4\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"bird noise level\">\r\n<h2>What type of bird (or birds) will be best for your family?</h2>\r\n<p>While each species of bird come with different characteristics and personality traits, there remain other factors to consider including the way a particular bird was raised and what age the bird is.</p>\r\n<h3>Hand-fed vs. parent-raised birds</h3>\r\n<p>Generally, hand-fed birds will be gentler from the start with everyone in the family since they are more used to human interaction during feeding times from the early stages of their lives. Hand-fed birds may require less training and hand-taming when you welcome your new pet into your home.</p>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/Petco-How-to-Choose-the-Right-Pet-Bird_600x400-F.v4\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"hand fed vs parent raised birds\">\r\n<p>Parent-raised birds, however, relied on their mother for feedings and may require additional training and patience before they are fully comfortable with human interaction.</p>\r\n<p>While many birds for sale have been hand-fed, it is important to confirm a bird’s personality with a store partner, or understand its history if you are adopting a pet.</p>\r\n<h3>Should you get a male or female pet bird?</h3>\r\n<p>It is often difficult to tell if a bird is male or female while looking at it since some pet birds do not have any external differing characteristics and the species will be the same size, color and shape no matter which sex they are. While many behaviors are also similar across male and female pet birds, you may notice a different in terms of the level of noise they make. For instance, female canaries are typically quieter than male canaries.</p>\r\n<p>However, identifying a male or female bird in a pet store may be difficult since special testing methods are required to differentiate between the sexes. Consult with a veterinarian that specializes in avian medicine to determine the sex of your pet bird.</p>\r\n<h3>Should you get a young bird or an older one?</h3>\r\n<p>Most bird pet parents tend to choose young birds, so they are able to train it from the start and know more about its personality. Although adopting an older bird can be more challenging in some ways, there are also rewards and advantages. Older birds may actually be well trained and friendly; and they tend to be less expensive.</p>\r\n<p>If you choose to get an older bird, be sure to check their background, and gather as much information as possible about their previous pet parent, diet, medical history, age and personality traits.</p>\r\n<p>Remember to keep your expectations realistic. Some older birds may have developed behavioral problems, such as biting, screaming or feather picking, which could be the reason the bird is up for adoption. Sometimes a bird\'s problems will moderate, or even disappear, in a new environment; a lot of TLC can help with that. Other times though, some birds will retain their habits for the remainder of their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Patience is an important requirement if you adopt an older bird. Some may bond with you right away, while others may take months. Some previously owned birds may have been neglected by uncaring owners or due to ignorance. Worse yet, some may have been abused. Birds raised under these circumstances will most likely require an extra dose of TLC to adjust properly.</p>\r\n<p>Some older birds may require a dietary change. This should be made gradually so that you can be sure your bird is eating enough to maintain a healthy weight. Although an older bird may be finicky, continue to offer the new food to him. Even if he refuses to eat it at first, he may come around eventually.</p>\r\n<h3>Should you get one or two pet birds?</h3>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/Petco-How-to-Choose-the-Right-Pet-Bird_600x400-E.v4\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"bird socialization\">\r\n<p>The answer to this question cannot be made without careful consideration and planning. Keep in mind that:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>By nature, birds are flock animals, forming strong bonds with other members and raising birds in pairs can help foster their flocking instinct.</li>\r\n<li>If you purchase or adopt a pair, they may bond to each other, and not to you. If you were looking to create a special connection with your new pet, or wanted to train him to talk, you may want to consider one vs. two.</li>\r\n<li>If two birds are kept in the same habitat, one will prove to be more dominant, which could lead to problems.</li>\r\n<li>If you are looking to have multiple birds, it is important that the species should be the same, so keep canaries with canaries, parakeets with parakeets, and so forth.</li>\r\n<li>The younger the birds, the greater the chance of successful mixing. So, introducing multiple birds sooner rather than later is a good idea, but introducing an older bird may be more difficult.</li>\r\n<li>Introducing a new pet to an existing one doesn\'t always work out; birds have their own personal preferences and might not be compatible with one another.</li>\r\n<li>The birds should be allowed to get to know each other from separate habitats initially; within a short time you can begin to move the habitats together.</li>\r\n<li>The birds\' first encounter should be outside their habitats; observe their behavior and be prepared to separate them. Never leave the area until you are certain the two birds will be compatible.</li>\r\n<li>Even if your birds cannot occupy the same habitat, they can still enjoy each other\'s company.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Should you get a bird with or without leg bands?</h3>\r\n<p>Most commercially sold birds will have metal bands around the lower portion of their legs. These bands are used for identification and to indicate where your bird was bred. These bands will become very important if your bird should get out of their habitat.</p>\r\n<p>The decision to remove the band is not a simple one. Closed bands should never be removed because they serve as the bird\'s birth certificate. However, removing open bands may help prevent injuries because bands can catch on habitats, wires, toys, and other objects. If your bird\'s leg is injured and swells, the band can cause additional damage. If you decide to remove the band, never do it by yourself; have your avian veterinarian remove the band. Be sure to save the band, or copy the information, for safekeeping.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Picking out your pet bird</h2>\r\n<p>Purchasing any pet can be an emotional decision. When selecting your bird remember to choose from your head, not just your heart; both you and your bird will be happier for it.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure that you have enough time to make a good decision when picking out your new pet, call ahead to the pet store, breeder or shelter and find out when their feeding and adoption times are so that you have ample opportunity to observe and interact with potential birds.</p>\r\n<p>If a child is helping make the selection, remember their choice is usually based on sight and emotion. They also can be easily overwhelmed by too many choices. If it is vital for your child to pick the pet, pre-select several options based on which pet would fit best into your family’s lifestyle and let your child choose from these options.</p>\r\n<h3>Making a Healthy Choice</h3>\r\n<p>With careful observation and the help of the following checklist, you should be able to tell if the particular bird you are singling out is healthy. A healthy bird should look alert when you approach them, those that appear dull and have fluffed-up feathers may be ill. Don\'t be misled by the plumage of a young bird, as young bird’s feathers rarely are as sleek as adult birds.</p>\r\n<p>Other health factors you should pay attention to include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Nostrils should be even in size and free of blockages</li>\r\n<li>Eyes should be clear, without discharge or a whitish opacity</li>\r\n<li>Bill should be a normal length with no signs of abnormality, such as the upper portion curving into the lower</li>\r\n<li>The feathering around the bill and on the head should be clean</li>\r\n<li>Locate your bird\'s breastbone by running your fingers down his underside to the mid-line; distinct hollows on either side indicate poor condition, possibly a result of a chronic illness.</li>\r\n<li>Legs should be smooth; heavy scaling can be a sign of old age</li>\r\n<li>Overgrown claws will require clipping</li>\r\n<li>Check for swelling on the bottom of the feet, the result of a bumble foot infection</li>\r\n<li>Your bird\'s toes should all end in claws, although on occasion, a claw may be missing</li>\r\n<li>Check the vent area for soiled feathering that could indicate a digestive disturbance</li>\r\n<li>Feces color can vary depending on the type of pellets the bird is eating, but lime green feces can indicate a serious health concern</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How much will your pet bird cost?</h2>\r\n<p>How much pet birds cost varies depending on the type of bird you choose. Design a budget for the pet bird you wish to get, and don’t forget all of the <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/bird\">bird supplies</a> that will also be needed. Beware of \"bargain birds\" as there could be some underlying issues. While exact prices will vary based on where you are located and other factors, you can expect costs similar to the below:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>A pair of finches can cost between $20 and $100</li>\r\n<li>A budgie is usually about $25</li>\r\n<li>Cockatiels range from $80 to $150</li>\r\n<li>Amazon greys can be between $700 to $1,500</li>\r\n<li>A hyacinth macaw can command more than $8,000!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Welcoming your new pet bird home</h2>\r\n<p>Now that you have purchased your bird, you have to transport them safely home. Bring your new bird home in a box or travel bird carrier rather than in full size habitat. This will be less stressful and should help your bird settle down instead of flapping about and possibly becoming injured. Pet stores can supply suitable carriers, but if you are purchasing your bird from a breeder, you may need to bring one.</p>\r\n<p>You should arrange to visit your veterinarian on the way home from picking up your new bird. The veterinarian will check your new bird to be sure it is healthy and answer any questions you may have.</p>\r\n<p>Don\'t wait until you bring your bird home before setting up their space. Have everything ready so that when you come home you can attend to your bird. You should learn how to properly handle your bird before you attempt to put them in their habitat. The store, rescue, breeder or your veterinarian can show how to do this. Even a tamed bird is likely to be nervous, so allow your bird to settle down on their own. Allow for an adjustment period once your pet is safely in their habitat. Leave yourself adequate time for introductions if you have other pets. Your new addition will need to be left alone for a while they can acclimate to their new surroundings in peace.</p>\r\n<p>An advance in domestic breeding and rearing of birds has resulted in healthier, tame young birds. Their increased availability has made birds even more popular as pets. For many, the company of these magnificent, unique and, in some cases, talking pets can make birds an attractive family addition. </p><h3>Related Articles</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><a hrefs=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/pet-guides/bird-guide.html\">Bird Guide</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/seasonal-topics/Top-Summer-Concerns-for-Pet-Birds.html\">Top Summer Concerns for Pet Birds</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/new-pet/Welcoming-Your-Pet-Bird-Home.html\">Welcoming Your Pet Bird Home</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-15 00:37:59', '2021-08-15 00:37:59'),

What you may not realize is that special needs and senior pets wait four times longer than the average adoptable animal to find forever homes.</p>\r\n<p>Special needs pets can provide a family the same unconditional love and joy as other pets. Take Pumba, a blind pig, as an example. Pumba was rescued by Vegaspigpets in September 2011 and had a very bad case of glaucoma that required an extensive and expensive surgery. Luckily, Vegaspigpets was able to raise enough money for Pumba\'s surgery, but his eyes were too far gone and had to be removed. Vegaspigpets thought they would be Pumba\'s forever home because they didn\'t believe anyone would want to adopt a blind pig. However, Victoria O., a finalist in Petco\'s Great One Contest, became Pumba\'s saving grace.</p>\r\n<p>Victoria and her family had been following Pumba\'s story and fell in love with him. She knew she had to adopt him. Thanks to Vegaspigpets, Pumba now has a loving home with Victoria and her family.

Even though Pumba is a special needs pet, he is a true member of Victoria\'s family and they wouldn\'t have him any other way.</p>\r\n<p>Like Victoria\'s story, there are many other reasons why adopting a special needs pet can be a great decision:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Companionship:</strong> Special needs pets are often the last to be adopted, so giving one a forever home will not only give them a fresh start at life, but will also make sure their emotional needs are met since they\'ll be able to give and receive love, attention and affection.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Teaches Responsibility:</strong> Adopting and caring for a pet with a\r\n</li><li><strong>Unconditional Love:</strong> Special needs pets in animal shelters will show unconditional love for giving them a second chance at life and a new, forever home.</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 14:37:40', '2021-08-18 14:37:40'),
(18, 16, '<p>When shelters are over capacity, they often look for temporary families to help care for pets. Below, you’ll find answers to common questions about pet fostering. With so many wonderful animals in need of a loving home we’re so glad you’ve taken an interest in finding out more about this truly admirable deed. </p>\r\n<h2>What is fostering?</h2>\r\n<p>When you foster a pet, you provide a short-term home for an animal that needs love and care until they’re adopted. Under your care, you’re enabling the pet to blossom so that prospective families will see his true personality. Plus, you’re removing many of the stresses that cause animals to “show” poorly in a shelter environment, such as constant barking, continuous introductions to strange people, and not being walked or played with on a regular basis. Best of all, by opening your heart and home, you are actually saving the lives of two animals: the one you are fostering and the one you’ve made room for at the shelter.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is fostering necessary?</h2>\r\n<p>Simply put, many shelters have too many animals. In many cities, pets that find themselves in shelters only have days to find a new home. Fostering saves the lives of these pets, giving them the time they need to get adopted. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, government animal care organizations, SPCAs, humane societies and foster-based rescues also need foster homes for animals that are not ready for adoption for any of the following reasons: </p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>They may need a temporary foster home until they are big enough or old enough to be adopted or undergo spaying or neutering. </li>\r\n<li>They may have problems with an illness or injury, which means that they need closely supervised time to recover in a loving environment.</li>\r\n<li>They are not able to become accustomed to staying in a shelter.</li>\r\n<li>They need the opportunity to experience in-home socialization and one-on-one behavior modification. </li>\r\n<li>Newborns might need to be bottle-fed on a regular schedule.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How do I benefit from fostering?</h2>\r\n<p>Here are just a few of the many benefits: </p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>You get the satisfaction of knowing that you were personally responsible for helping save an animal’s life.</li>\r\n<li>You make new friends. Fostering is a great way to meet people who care about animals.</li>\r\n<li>You learn about different breeds. Working with various breeds can help you make a more informed decision when and if you consider adopting in the future.</li>\r\n<li>You experience the joy of knowing you’ve saved the lives of multiple animals: the one(s) you’re fostering and the one(s) you’ve helped make room for at the shelter.</li>\r\n<li>Your fostering efforts are tax-deductible! Ask your tax professional for advice.</li>\r\n<li>You can engage children in a family project that not only teaches responsibility, but is also fun and rewarding at the same time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How long will for the foster animal live with me?</h2>\r\n<p>The answer to this question can depend on the situation and the animal. For puppies and kittens, you may be asked to help get them to an adoptable age, which can be up to 12 to 16 weeks old. Adult cats and dogs that are recovering from an illness or injury may need additional rehabilitation time before they can attend an adoption event. In other cases, your foster’s stay could be short if you regularly attend weekend adoption events and actively participate in sharing the pet’s picture and details on social media and on flyers posted on community billboards. </p>\r\n<h2>Are there any requirements to become a foster pet parent?</h2>\r\n<p>There are some basic requirements:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Time. Many shelters ask that you attend some adoption events with your foster pet or post them on social media, or post flyers to community bulletin boards.</li>\r\n<li>Dedicated space. You will need to provide enough space in your home for the foster animal to be comfortable and safe. Space in shelters is limited, so your home will provide a much calmer, welcoming arrangement.</li>\r\n<li>TLC. Some of the animals may be in need of some extra TLC, and all of them just need basic care and your compassion.</li>\r\n<li>Paperwork. You will need to comply with age requirements and show proof of vaccinations for pets currently in your home. </li>\r\n<li>Toys, bedding and food. While some shelters will provide supplies, such as prescription medicines, along with toys and food, others cannot. Be sure to talk with the shelter to determine what they can provide for the pet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>What supplies do I need?</h2>\r\n<p>You will need to provide healthy food, treats, toys and possibly a crate for your foster pet. We recommend natural nutrition for optimum health benefits. Your veterinarian or Petco store partners can help you choose the best products for the complete care of your foster pet.</p>\r\n<h2>Can I foster if I already have a pet?</h2>\r\n<p>Depending on the animal rescue and the pet, you might need to initially keep your own animals separate from your foster animals. This will prevent any possible spread of illness and gives your new foster animal time to settle in. You are encouraged to eventually allow the animals to interact while under supervision.</p>\r\n<h2>Is it possible to adopt the animal I foster?</h2>\r\n<p>It’s understandable that a foster pet might steal your heart. If you’re interested in adopting your foster pet, make sure to tell your foster coordinator as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>How do I get started?</h2>\r\n<p>Once you have decided that you would like to be a foster parent, get in touch with a local animal rescue. Depending on the organization, you might need to fulfill certain requirements. Foster organizations can help you find an animal that is the best fit for you.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 14:40:26', '2021-08-18 14:40:26'),
(19, 17, '<p>An animal shelter can be a very stressful place for a homeless dog or cat. The constant barking and meowing and the continuous foot traffic from shelter staff and people looking to adopt can be both scary and intimidating. Many cats and dogs are also bewildered as to how they got there in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>Many animals may appear timid, may hide in the back of their cages or may even hide under their bedding. As a result, it can be very difficult to get a grasp of their true personality. That shy, timid, frightened pet may actually become a fun-loving clown when you bring him home. Many animals begin to blossom once they are in a loving home environment. </p>\r\n<p>Here\'s how to find the perfect pet for your family:</p>\r\n<h2>Plan ahead</h2>\r\n<p>Bringing a new pet into your home is a lifelong responsibility. Don\'t rush into a decision. It may even require several visits to the shelter before you make a final commitment.</p>\r\n<p>You can make the decision a bit easier if you narrow down some of your decisions:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>What type of dog or cat are you looking for?</li>\r\n<li>Do you want a puppy or a kitten?</li>\r\n<li>Would you prefer an adult dog or cat?</li>\r\n<li>Would you consider giving a loving home to a senior pet or one with special needs? </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you have very young children:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Consider leaving them in the care of a friend or family member when you make your initial visit. Children can get overly excited and their enthusiasm can be intimidating for a dog or cat meeting them for the first time. </li>\r\n<li>Once you have focused in on a particular dog or cat that is the time to take the kids along and introduce them to the animal in the shelter\'s hospitality room, or, in the case of a dog, outside in the exercise area. </li>\r\n<li>Most shelters or rescues will not hold pets for you, so have your kids nearby if you anticipate you\'ll be adopting a pet the same day as your first visit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How to assess an animal at a shelter</h2>\r\n<p>Most shelters will have kennel cards on each cage that provide basic information about the animal, including age, whether or not the pet is owner relinquished, any obvious health issues, and, sometimes, how the animal does with other animals. it\'s also important to try to assess for yourself the health, demeanor and personality of a potential pet:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Does the animal appear healthy? Are his eyes clear or runny? Is he sneezing?</li>\r\n<li>Does the stool in his cage or kennel seem solid and formed?</li>\r\n<li>Is he showing any signs of aggression, such as hissing or growling?</li>\r\n<li>When it comes to felines, does the cat or the kitten stand up and try and attract your attention when you walk past the cage? Once again, don\'t be deterred if he is a bit shy. Cats or kittens that are hiding or facing away from you may simply need a bit more socializing. You will have to determine if you have time at home to spend extra time working with the cat to help coax him out of his shell.</li>\r\n<li>How does the dog or cat move and walk? Check for any signs of awkwardness.</li>\r\n<li>Kittens or puppies are often kept together in their original litters. Check how the kitten or puppy that catches your attention reacts to his littermates.</li>\r\n<li>How does the dog or cat respond if you approach the cage and wiggle your fingers?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Shelter volunteers are happy to answer all your questions. Often the volunteers have spent enough time around the animal to provide additional insight into what the pet likes or unique behaviours.</p>\r\n<h2>Assessing a pet\'s health</h2>\r\n<p>These days, shelters go to great lengths to ensure that their pets are well-groomed and free of fleas, ticks and ear mites. Many shelters also work with animal behaviourists who volunteer their time to ensure that pets are well socialized, as this gives them a better chance of overcoming the stresses of the shelter environment and ultimately of being adopted. </p>\r\n<p>Many animals that end up in shelters have had a rough time and may not have glossy coats as a result of being previously malnourished. Don\'t let this deter you. Proper food and a loving, stress-free home can often turn around a dull coat.</p>\r\n<h2>Animals with special needs</h2>\r\n<p>Many animals with physical disabilities, medical problems or behavioral issues end up in shelters, too. Caring for a special needs pet can be very rewarding experience. Before you undertake this extra responsibility, talk to your veterinarian about what is involved with the pet\'s care to ensure you can afford the additional expenses and time commitments you may encounter. Also, <i>never</i> undertake this responsibility unless there is someone at home full-time.</p>\r\n<h2>Get to know the animals</h2>\r\n<p>There may be several animals that get your attention at the shelter. Ask a volunteer to arrange for you to spend some time with each animal separately in one of the shelter\'s hospitality rooms.</p>\r\n<p>These private areas are often away from the shelter activity and noise and the one-on-one time gives you both a chance to interact. For animals that are stressed and cower in their cages, a visit will give them an opportunity to come out of their shell a little bit and slowly begin to react to you. Remember, be patient. </p>\r\n<p>If you think you have found the perfect dog or cat to become your newest family member, arrange for the shelter to put them on hold so you can arrange to bring your children to visit. It\'s important to explain to kids to sit quietly and observe and initiate games slowly. This gives the animal an opportunity to inspect them, too.</p>\r\n<h2>The paperwork</h2>\r\n<p>Once you have made your decision, the shelter will require you to fill out adoption forms, which can be lengthy. Expect questions about:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Where do you live?</li>\r\n<li>Do you have a suitable outdoor area for a dog? </li>\r\n<li>For cats, expect the shelter to request that you guarantee in writing that the cat will have an indoor-only lifestyle. </li>\r\n<li>The shelter also will want to know about other pets and people in the home. </li>\r\n<li>Many shelters will require confirmation that all consenting adults in the home agree to the adoption. They are looking after the animal\'s best interests and ensuring the pet is going to a loving, forever home.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Adoption fees</h2>\r\n<p>Adoption fees vary from shelter to shelter. They cover the cost of any medical care the pet may have received as well as the spay/neuter operation, if not previously done, vaccinations and deworming.</p>\r\n<p>Another reason for an adoption fee is because shelters believe a monetary commitment helps people to underline the responsibility of pet parenting and the promise to give a pet a good home.</p>\r\n<h2>Home inspections</h2>\r\n<p>Many rescues will not release a pet into your care before they have made a home inspection to confirm it\'s a safe and clean environment. This is because they take entrusting a pet into your care very seriously and want the best situation for that pet to thrive and be safe.</p>\r\n<p>While adopting a pet is a commitment, it\'s also important to inquire about the shelter\'s return policy, just in case things don\'t work out.</p>\r\n<p>Most shelters provide you with as much information as they can about your new pet (you\'ll receive more if the pet was owner relinquished). This also will include a health assessment from a veterinarian. Additionally, you\'ll likely receive a few supplies and a sample of the food the pet is currently eating.<strong> Be sure to use this food and slowly transition to any new food.</strong> This will help prevent upset stomach and intestinal distress. You can always transition slowly to another brand or formula later. For the same reasons, don\'t rush to change the brand of cat litter. Again, when the time is right, make it a slow transition.</p>\r\n<p>Settling in to a new home is quite a transition for a pet. It may take your pet a couple of weeks to begin to shine. Have patience. Don\'t invite a lot of family and friends over to meet the newest family member until you feel they are comfortable in their new home.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 14:46:06', '2021-08-18 14:46:06'),

(21, 19, '<p>Adopting a pet to grow your family is one of the best ways for an animal lover to help spread their love. Luckily, there are a number of resources for finding your perfect pet match. Begin by learning about the various adoption options to determine which ones are most likely to result in the outcome you hope to achieve.</p>\r\n<h2>Where to adopt a dog or cat</h2>\r\n<p>Pet adoption can occur in a number of different ways, and taking the time to understand how the process works for each one can help you along the way. Adoption options include:<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Animal Shelters and Humane Societies</strong></p>\r\n<p>The world is too full of dogs and cats waiting for a home and many end up at local shelters or humane societies. While many pets can live out the rest of their lives in these locations, some shelters are overcrowded and can only provide temporary homes for a certain number of days. That’s why an animal shelter or humane society is a great place to start your search for a pet.&nbsp; If there’s one in your area, plan a visit. You can meet adoptable animals and learn about volunteer opportunities and special adoption events. A current resident might be just what you’re looking for.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Shelters and humane societies often include an adoption fee that can range anywhere from $50 up to a few hundred dollars or more, but that usually includes the cost of a spay or neuter and shots. Before taking a pet home, you may be asked to answer questions or fill out paperwork to provide them with more insight into your lifestyle, time the pet will spend alone most days, the type of home/yard you have, additional pets you might have, etc. Some shelters require a home visit to ensure you’ve properly pet-proofed and are set up for your new family member’s arrival. For specific details about the process your local shelter or society follows, give them a call and ask.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Breed Rescue Groups</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you’re in the market for a specific breed, you may want to start your search with a breed enthusiast group or breed-specific rescue association. Before heading down this route, though, do your research to learn if the temperament and care requirements of the breed you’re interested in match your specific wants and lifestyle.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Shelters are usually aware of local breed rescues and can provide referrals. Potential dog parents can also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/akc-rescue-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Kennel Club Rescue Network</a>, while <a href=\"https://tica.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The International Cat Association</a> is a good resource for would-be cat parents. Breed rescue groups often use foster pet parents to take care of animals until they find a home. Because they often spend a lot of time with the animals they care for, foster pet parents are particularly well qualified to tell you about the personality and characteristics of a dog or cat you may be interested in adopting. Their insights can help ease the transition when you bring your new pet home. Adopting through a breed rescue group is similar to working with a shelter, in that the organization will take steps to ensure you are the right match for the pet and that your home offers a suitable environment for that pet. Again, how much you pay to adopt from a breed rescue can vary from $0 on up to $250 or more. Since each breed and group is different, be sure to talk with the administrator about the process, fees and specifics up front so they don’t&nbsp; come as a surprise when your perfect pet comes along.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Work with Your Veterinarian</strong></p>\r\n<p>Veterinarians can be a wealth of knowledge about adoption opportunities in your area, especially when it comes to helping rehome patients whose parents can no longer care for them. Veterinary technicians or volunteers at vet offices, who may also volunteer at shelters or help out as foster pet parents, may be able to point you in the right direction as well. If your veterinarian’s office has a bulletin board, you can start there, or ask at the reception desk.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> The process of adopting through your veterinarian—as well as what you end up paying—will vary widely based on the circumstance. For example, if your veterinarian happens to know an elderly pet parent who needs to find a new loving home for the dog they can no longer care for, that adoption process could be fairly straightforward and free. If, on the other hand, your veterinarian sets you up with a shelter or breed-specific rescue group, you’ll likely go through their regular process and pay something within the fee range mentioned above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Pet Adoption Websites</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pet adoption websites—like <a href=\"https://www.adoptapet.com/\">adoptapet.com</a> or the adopt a pet feature on are gaining in popularity, and they can be a great way to start your adoption search from the comfort of your own home. Most of these sites help draw in rescue options that are available at your local shelters or with rescue groups, as well as animals currently residing with foster pet parents. These sites can be an asset if you’re looking for a pet with specific attributes, since you can often search by breed, age and gender, among other factors.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> These sites often only act as aggregators for shelters or other adoption organizations in your area. Once you click on a pet you’re interested in, you’ll likely be taken to that shelter or rescue’s website for more information or to fill out an email interest sheet. After that, the process would follow the traditional ones for a shelter or breed-specific rescue group listed above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Friends and Family</strong></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps one of the easiest ways to start your adoption search is by getting the word out to friends and family that you’re looking to adopt a pet. Many different factors contribute to people <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/adoption-rescue/how-to-re-home-your-pet.html\">giving up their beloved pets</a>, and most are very grateful when a new loving home comes along quickly. Plus, if you end up adopting through someone you know, you have the added benefit of being able to contact them with any questions, as well as potentially keep some of the supplies that the pet is already used to.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>The process:</strong> Adopting a pet from a friend or family member could be easier than going through a shelter or breeder, but you’ll still want to make sure you do your due diligence. For example, before taking home any pet, be sure to ask about shot, health and microchip records and whether the animal is spayed or neutered, and ask for copies of any veterinary records so you can stay on top of or get ahead of health issues.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>My Puppy My Pet Adoption Events</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1rem;\">My Puppy My Pet</span>&nbsp;makes it easy to find your new furry family member by allowing you to meet adoptable pets at your local store.

(22, 20, '<p>We love our dogs so much that it can be easy to forget that their instincts are not always aligned with what we need for a harmonious household. With proper training, we have a chance to set everyone up to be successful by showing our pups what we would like them to do in order to fit into our lifestyles. The best way to help keep you and your dog—and everyone your dog comes into contact with—safe and happy is to properly train your pup. Of course, there’s more to dog training than just “sit” and “stay”. Here’s everything you need to know to prepare for your successful training journey.</p>\r\n<h2>Why dog training classes are important</h2>\r\n<p>Proper training is essential for a long, happy and safe relationship with your dog as it sets the foundation for physical fitness, mental alertness, social engagement and emotional stability. Dogs thrive when they are shown what we prefer them to do to fit into their family\'s routine. When they’re left without an understanding of what’s preferred they may create their own habits and routines. A dog who’s properly trained is also better company, which makes social outings and home visits much less stressful.</p>\r\n<p>As a pet parent, it’s important to remember that training happens every time you interact with your dog and occurs throughout your dog’s life. Patience is one of the keys to successful training. Training that’s done improperly—or inconsistently—is less effective. The best way to ensure that your dog is properly trained and that their training sticks, is to enroll them in professional training classes with a certified dog trainer.</p>\r\n<h2>How dog training works</h2>\r\n<p>If you’ve never been through dog training, it’s helpful to know how it works before you sign up. You’ll learn what to expect with each class and be able to continue following the proper training principles at home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The My Puppy My Pet-certified Positive Dog Trainers at My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;abide by a science-based, positive reinforcement dog-training philosophy. This means that training classes follow rewards-based, fun and effective methods to instill positive behaviors and that appeal to your dog. Training focuses on rewarding dogs for doing things correctly, making them more likely to repeat those behaviors, while dissuading negative behaviors through management and refocusing tactics. Positive reinforcement training has been proven effective in not only training any type learner but also in building a strong bond between pet parents and their dogs.</p>\r\n<h3>Dog training class schedule</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">My Puppy My Pet</span>&nbsp;offers dog training classes for every level of learner in an environment that sets both dog and pet parent up to succeed long after classes have ended. Here’s what’s offered:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Puppy Level 1:</strong> This is a 6-week introductory group class for 2- to 4-month-old puppies. It covers the basics that every puppy needs, including socialization, potty training, preventing/redirecting chewing, digging and more.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Puppy Level 2:</strong> This 6-week group class for 4- to 6-month-old puppies expands upon the basics learned in Level 1, plus introduces the concept of establishing behaviors as routine and teaches fun games to keep puppies mentally stimulated and engaged.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Adult Dog Level 1:</strong> This 6-week course is designed for dogs over 6 months old to establish better communication with pet parents. Cues like “leave it” and “wait” will be covered, along with loose-leash walking and mitigating undesirable behaviors like jumping, barking and digging.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Adult Dog Level 2:</strong> This 6-week course designed for dogs who have graduated from Adult Dog Level 1 covers more advanced and complex training environments to ensure you and your dog are ready for more distracting situations. Additional fun games for physical and mental stimulation are also covered.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Private Training Lessons:</strong> More customized training solutions and one-on-one instruction built for the training goals you have for your dog are offered.

Learn more about the classes here.</p>\r\n<h3>Dog training basic behaviors</h3>\r\n<p>When you bring your dog to a professional My Puppy My Pet dog training class, you can expect them to learn foundational behaviors, and then some. Foundational behaviors include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Come: Getting your dog to come to you whenever called is one of the most vital behaviors to have in your repertoire.</li>\r\n<li>Down: A position that may be more comfortable for your dog to “wait” or “stay” in, especially when they need to stay for an extended period of time..&nbsp;<br>Go to your bed: A good place to send them but still have them nearby when you have company or are eating meals. &nbsp; ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Leave it: When cued, your dog will leave an object/thing/person alone and refocus their attention on you.</li>\r\n<li>Loose-leash walking: Most pet parents expect their dog to walk nicely on a leash without pulling. Positive training methods and proper equipment will help you teach this.</li>\r\n<li>Sit: Useful when you’re attaching your dog’s leash, greeting people, giving medication, brushing them, etc</li>\r\n<li>Stay: Teaches them to not move from a specific position such as \"sit.\"</li>\r\n<li>Wait: Don\'t cross this boundary (a doorway, for example). Your dog doesn\'t have to sit or lie down, just not move forward.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Dog training tips</h2>\r\n<p>Although the most important things to keep in mind when it comes to properly training your pup is understanding, patience and consistency, it’s useful to also remember:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Puppies can learn, too:</strong> You’d be surprised at how early a puppy can begin picking up on training cues. Start at home with short sessions to see how much your puppy can learn.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Keep sessions short:</strong> Puppies have especially short attention spans, so dedicate no more than a few minutes to each behavior to start.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Get the right products:</strong> Depending on your goals for your dog, there might be a product on the market that can help you with your training. For example, if your dog pulls the leash while walking, a no-pull harness or head halter designed to curb this behavior might help. Providing your puppy with appropriate <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/dog/dog-toys/dog-chew-toys\">chew toys</a> can also help abate chewing issues while promoting oral health and reducing boredom. A My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;trainer can help point you in the right direction based on the behavior you are looking for.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Reward on time:</strong> Dogs connect verbal praise to what they did very close in time to when the praise occurred. Appropriate and preferred behaviors should be rewarded immediately.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pick the right rewards:</strong> When focusing on positive reinforcement, having the proper rewards, or reinforcers, to convey&nbsp; “well done, more of that please,” is essential. Keep treats small, soft and delicious, and make sure your dog likes what you’re providing. Other reward options are verbal praise, pets/scratches, toys, play—whatever your dog enjoys and reacts well to.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Remember—crates can be great:</strong> Rather than considering crates restrictive, think of them as an easy way to keep your dog safe while you’re not home and help eliminate potential unwanted behaviors that can arise from boredom or loneliness. Make the crate experience fun by introducing it in a positive and rewarding way, hiding tasty treats or putting a food-stuffed toy inside.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> As you work with your dog, they will learn to repeat the behaviors that you reinforce. It is important that every family member has agreed on which behaviors are acceptable and preferred, how to consistently reinforce these behaviors and what to do when a less favored behavior is observed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do your part:</strong> Proper dog training is a partnership between you and your dog. That means listening during class and following up at home. For example, when it comes to house training, show your dog where elimination should take place, and stick to the routine. By staying patient and consistent, you’ll be more likely to succeed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A properly trained dog is not only safer but a pleasure to be around. My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;has all the expert advice you need and classes to fit any training level.

(24, 21, '<h2>Steps for teaching a puppy to walk on a leash</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s important to remember that puppies won’t instinctively understand how to walk on a leash. Pet parents should be prepared to spend time training their young dogs to walk properly on a leash.</p>\r\n<p>Lina Eklof, dog training education manager for My Puppy My Pet, says that the best place to start is with a “sit” behavior.</p>\r\n<p>After getting your puppy safely leashed with a collar or harness, ask them to sit by your side. “This is a cue to let them know you are both facing forward and ready to start together as a team,” she says.</p>\r\n<p>Next, make sure you have your training treats in the hand closest to your puppy. “Otherwise the puppy can pull in front of you to reach the treats,” says Eklof.</p>\r\n<p>Once you and your puppy are ready, and your dog is sitting by your side, you can begin moving forward. “Circle around your puppy, waiting for them to notice you and catch up,” says Eklof. “Treat the instant they do. Simply move around until the puppy moves to be near you and treat their behavior.”</p>\r\n<p>Don’t try to control the situation. Let your puppy get comfortable making decisions on their own. If they approach you while on their leash, offer praise and hand out a treat. If they are walking by your side, offer praise and hand out a treat.</p>\r\n<p>Try to change the pace and direction of your walk. As your puppy follows along and walks with their head by your knee, make sure to continue to offer rewards and praise.</p>\r\n<p>In the early stages of learning, says Eklof, you’ll need to use a lot of treats. Look for a low-calorie, small-size training treat specifically designed for this type of activity.</p>\r\n<p>As your puppy gets more comfortable walking on a leash, you can add other training cues into your walking routine to get in practice and keep your puppy on their toes.</p>\r\n<p>“Doing simple things like asking your dog to sit and paying for performance with a high-value treat is an easy way to interact with your dog, and a way to make the walk more enjoyable for all involved,” says Visconti. “Ask your dog for a ‘watch’ or ‘look at me’ cue while moving. Be sure to pay for good performance.”</p>\r\n<h2>How to stop a dog from pulling on a leash</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you’re training a puppy to walk on a leash or you’re working with an older dog, leash-pulling may occur. Dogs can become overly excited and try to run out ahead of you, tugging you along.</p>\r\n<p>If this happens, says Eklof, you can try two things: First, you can simply stop, wait for your dog to calm down and return to your side, and start up again. Or you can turn and start walking the other way and encourage your dog to catch up with you.</p>\r\n<p>If your dog or puppy continues to pull on the leash, don’t get frustrated and reprimand them. Simply keep working on rewarding good behavior with high-value treats and using an upbeat, positive voice. Soon enough, your dog will start to learn and associate the right behaviors with beneficial rewards.</p>\r\n<h2>Is leash training an older dog possible?</h2>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/dog-harness-walk\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"dog walking with harness\">\r\n<p>Although leash training an older, adult dog may take more time and dedication, it’s never too late to train good behaviors. In these instances, routine training sessions and continual practice are key to getting your dog to learn good leash behavior.</p>\r\n<p>If your dog shows any signs of leash reactivity, make sure to be extra cautious when out on training sessions or walks until they are more comfortable on the leash. This is especially important in areas where you may encounter off-leash dogs. “Be prepared for how you’ll respond,” says Visconti. “Better still, walk your dog in areas where this is less likely to occur.”</p>\r\n<p>If you’re struggling to train an older dog to walk on the leash, consider enrolling your dog in training classes or work with a dedicated trainer or behaviorist who can help you address your dog’s specific behavioral problems.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">My Puppy My Pet</span>&nbsp;offers private lessons and training classes for puppies and dogs, whether you need leash-training help or starting off on the right paw!</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 15:26:16', '2021-08-18 15:26:16'),

Before we get started, it\'s important to note that, while each of the techniques detailed here can help to control a dog\'s barking, it will take time and dedication to effectively reverse the behavior.

(26, 22, '<h2>Why Do Dogs Bark?</h2>\r\n<p>To start, you\'ll want to establish what is causing your pup to bark in the first place. There are a variety of reasons your dog may be barking:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>As an alert – they see or sense something that is new to themAs a way to show excitement – they see a friend or are happily playing with another pup</li>\r\n<li>As a defense mechanism – something is making them feel anxious or fearful</li>\r\n<li>As a way to get your attention</li>\r\n<li>As a way to amuse themselves – usually to alleviate boredom</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>As you can see, barking is one of your dog\'s most important (and effective) communication tools, and not all barking habits are bad. It\'s easy to understand appropriate barking in certain situations, but there are also times when that behavior isn\'t desired. And it\'s important for your dog to understand that habitual, incessant barking is not allowed. </p>\r\n<h2>How to Train a Dog Not to Bark Through Positive Training</h2>\r\n<p>In order to successfully stop dog barking, you will need to define and train an alternate, positive behavior. This should include techniques that work to make dog training an enjoyable and rewarding activity for them. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/s/petco-dog-training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p>\r\n<p>Much like their human parents, dogs thrive on positive reinforcement, and will repeat behaviors that bring them desirable outcomes -- and that includes barking. Remember, there\'s always a reason your dog is barking. Determining the cause is vital to managing their behavior. </p>\r\n<p>For example, your dog might start to bark whenever they hear your doorbell ring. When this happens, start by thanking them for alerting you of the new visitor, then redirect them to another behavior, such as the \"sit\" command, or telling them to \"go to your spot\" – their crate or a mat. </p>\r\n<p>Give them plenty of praise and positive reinforcement, such as treats, when choosing the appropriate behavior. This aids in guiding your pup to desirable behaviors, because they are rewarded each time which will reinforce that behavior to happen again. </p>\r\n<p>Make sure your dog is getting enough exercise and mental stimulation; a dog with pent-up energy may be more likely to excessively bark. The breed of your dog will also play a factor in the amount of physical exercise and mental stimulation that is required.</p>\r\n<p>For example, a Border Collie or similar working breed will demand far more exercise and stimulation than a more laid-back breed such as a Basset Hound. Taking walks, playing ball and just being active with you will help your dog to regulate barking during quieter times. </p>\r\n<p>Some dogs benefit from being taught a \"speak\" cue. Your ultimate goal is to introduce both a \"speak\" and a \"quiet\" cue. Once the dog understands the difference, the \"quiet\" cue can possibly be used to silence unwanted barking\r\n.</p>\r\n<h2>Dog Training Collars and Resources</h2>\r\n<p>If your dog\'s bad barking habits have gone untreated for a long period of time, they might require more work to change. Dogs learn best when presented with long-term, consistent guidance from their parents— one-time \"quick fixes\" usually aren\'t effective. </p>\r\n<p>Working with a professional trainer can be beneficial for both you and your pup to redirect their ingrained barking habits. Professional Dog Trainers work with many types of dogs and can help you in determining the cause of your pet\'s behavior and provide positive solutions for changing it. </p>', 'storage/1629279648.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-18 15:40:48', '2021-08-18 15:40:48'),

By setting a good example and demonstrating the proper way to handle, groom, and play with your pet, your children will understand the best and safest methods. It also helps to instill an appreciation of cats and their unique characteristics.</p>\r\n<p>If you explain that felines are independent and sometimes prefer to be alone, you’ll limit the confusion young children experience when cats are less social. Instead of feeling disappointment when your pet isn’t up for playtime, your kids will give your cat the privacy and space they need.</p>\r\n<h2>Kids Taking Care of a Cat</h2>\r\n<p>When caring for a dog, children can help with important tasks like daily walks and games of fetch. But when it comes to taking care of a cat, your child has limited opportunities. Not to worry, you can still encourage bonding between cats and kids with age-appropriate tasks.</p>\r\n<p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) recommends supervised play with cats for children ages five to ten and suggests tasks like feeding or cleaning the litter box for children ages ten to thirteen.

Teach your children how to give cats treats, or, how to grow and trim cat grass or catnip for afternoon snacks. If grooming is an area of interest, gentle brushing is okay as long as your cat enjoys it.</p>\r\n<h2>Supporting Interactive Play with Toys</h2>\r\n<p>Playtime is essential to the health and happiness of your cat. Aside from getting your feline up and moving, it helps foster a loving bond. When choosing cat toys, consider your pet’s personality and how they engage in play. This ensures they\'ll be excited and challenged when it\'s time to play.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have a good selection, show your kids a game of chase using a feather teaser, furry mouse, or ball. A game of “catch it” with a laser pointer or flashlight on the wall is another interactive activity your children and pet will enjoy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It’s also a good idea to educate your children about playing with your pet. Here\'s what they should know:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cats are creatures of habit and stick to a routine. Playtime should occur at the same time each day for consistency.</li>\r\n<li>Short bursts of activity in intervals of 15 minutes, once or twice a day, is recommended. This makes it manageable but also benefits the emotional and physical health of your pet.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid shouting, jumping, and running. With cats being sensitive to noise and movement, these behaviors can upset or frighten them.</li>\r\n<li>Never make hands the focus of any game. If you do, it will encourage your cat to claw and bite hands or engage in predatory play. Instead, make interactive toys the focal point.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining Safety for Cats and Kids</h2>\r\n<p>Cats and kids can develop strong, loving friendships, but it’s important to keep safety as the top priority. With proper supervision, you can create a safe environment in your home and observe how your child handles your pet. If you notice any unnecessary pulling or yanking, put an end to it right away. Aside from causing unintentional harm, this treatment can lead cats to scratch or bite if feeling threatened.</p>\r\n<p>Ensuring your cat is up to date on their vaccinations and scheduled for regular veterinary check-ups is another way to maintain a safe home. These precautions not only promote the health of your cat but also protect your child’s health. Show your kids the importance of keeping your cat healthy and happy by allowing them to tag-a-long to veterinary visits.</p>\r\n<p>The final area you need to consider is hygiene. Teaching your child to wash their hands after feeding your pet or cleaning the litter box will help limit the transfer of bacteria and germs.</p>\r\n<p>Encouraging a positive relationship between cats and kids is a wonderful way to promote family bonding.

They fall under problems with the box size, location, cleanliness, and multiple cats sharing one box. After learning these behaviors you’ll have the information you need to know where to put a litter box, how to clean it, and how to get your cat to use it.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Problems with Litter Box Size</h2>\r\n<p>If your cat feels cramped and cannot maneuver with ease, they’ll associate negative feelings with their litter box. To avoid this and find a proper size, select a box that is much larger than your cat. They should have enough room to step inside, turn around, scratch, and squat without touching the sides of the box.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a kitten or senior cat, you will need to consider the height of the walls as well. You can check out our guide for more tips to help you choose an appropriate litter box size for your pet.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Bad Litter Box Location</h2>\r\n<p>Your cat prefers privacy when they use their litter box, so avoid placing it in noisy or high-traffic areas of your home. Once you find a quiet place, think about the surrounding area. Cats don’t like to eat where they “go,” so never place food and water bowls next to or anywhere near your feline’s litter box.</p>\r\n<p>As your cat ages, you may need to reconsider where you put the litter box. It might seem like they stop using their box for no reason but the pain from arthritis and joint issues could be what’s keeping them from getting to it. To help, don’t place their box in the upper or lower levels of the home like a basement. Instead, choose a location that provides a clear and easy path. Finding a good place is also a benefit for you since it makes cleaning less burdensome.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Litter Box Isn\'t Cleaned Often</h2>\r\n<p>Because cats are clean by way of habit, they expect you to keep their litter boxes in pristine condition. If they feel their sacred place is dirty or has lingering odors, they will find a new place to relieve themselves. To help prevent unwanted smells, select a cleaning brand with ingredients such as carbon or plant extracts that get rid of odors from urine and fecal matter.</p>', 'storage/1629283276.jpg', 'imgbanner', '2021-08-18 16:41:16', '2021-08-18 16:41:16'),

Be sure to make the switch before your cat’s strong olfactory senses kick in and they notice the odors absorbed by the plastic material.</p>\r\n<h2>4. They Don\'t Like Sharing</h2>\r\n<p>Figuring out the litter box situation for multiple cats is tricky. With felines being territorial and sticklers for privacy, they may stop using their litter box if they feel it is never available. The general rule is one litter box per cat, plus an extra box, placed in different locations throughout the house. You can also consider open litter pans so your cat can see when another cat is approaching and plan their escape.</p>\r\n<p>Your cat’s litter box plays a big role in their life. It can also be a useful tool that helps you recognize sudden changes in their health or well-being.

(34, 25, '<p>There’s nothing quite like the feeling that comes with bringing a new kitten home as a proud pet parent. But before introducing your pet to their new home, there are a few things you should know. Consult these tips to make sure you’re well prepared for bringing home a kitten.</p>\r\n<h2>Set Up a Suitable Place for a Catnap</h2>\r\n<p>Kitten proofing your home means designating places in your pad that are comfortable and safe for your pet, and what better way to start than making a comfy spot for them to lay their head. Cats can sleep up to 15 hours a day on average, so you’ll want to make sure their napping place is a special space just for them. Kittens are used to snuggling up to their moms and siblings for comfort and warmth, so they prefer to curl up in snug areas. Beds lined with soft, warm blankets or towels work best.</p>\r\n<h2>Provide a Private Potty</h2>\r\n<p>It’s important that your kitten’s litter box is located in a spot that’s both convenient and private, but not close to their food and water stations. Cats do not like that smell near their food, and can you blame them? If you already have another cat, consider giving your new kitten a box of their own, as cats can be territorial and not prone to sharing a litter box. The American Association of Feline Practitioners recommends one litter box per cat, plus one extra.</p>\r\n<h2>Poison-Proof Your Pad</h2>\r\n<p>We all know what they say about cats and curiosity. Before bringing a new kitten home, be sure to move items that are poisonous to your pet to a spot that’s out of reach. The ASPCA has tagged the following as worthy of extra attention when cat proofing your house: citronella candles, flea products, vitamins, rat and mouse bait, mothballs, liquid potpourri and fabric softener sheets.</p>\r\n<h2>Stock Up on Cat Toys</h2>\r\n<p>Cats love to stalk, chase and pounce; developing a natural desire to play with toys by the time they’re just two weeks old. Therefore, it’s a good idea to have a variety of cat toys ready for play before bringing home a kitten. Provide plenty of toys for them to choose from, such as toy fishing poles, catnip toys, stuffed animals and feathered strings to keep your kitten physically fit and mentally alert.</p>\r\n<h2>Provide a Scratching Post to Save Your Furniture</h2>\r\n<p>A cat’s claws need to be worn down, so unless you want your furniture shredded, it’s best to provide a scratching space you approve of early on. There are a variety of options available for your cat to sink their claws into such as carpeted or sisal scratching posts, cardboard scratchers, cat trees, and more! Offering a variety of approved scratching options lessens the chance that your feline friend will have to find one on its own.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 16:44:51', '2021-08-18 16:44:51'),
(35, 26, '<p>Birds are intelligent pets with a lot of personality, but sometimes you may notice a change in behavior that puzzles you. There is no such thing as a bad bird, or bad bird behavior. Instead, birds respond to changes in their environment in ways that make sense to them—even though their actions may not make sense to you.</p>\r\n<p>If your bird exhibits a change in behavior that you find undesirable, it’s your job as a pet parent to determine the cause. It may take some detective work or a consultation with an expert, but if you observe your pet and learn about his normal behavior, you should be able to help take the mystery out of the behavioral changes and work with him to get results that are more desirable to you.</p>\r\n<h2>Boredom and neglect</h2>\r\n<p>Boredom and neglect are two of the most common causes of behavior changes in birds. These behaviors can sometimes be manifested as anger or frustration—which can result in biting, screaming or feather plucking. While it’s important for your bird to be able to entertain himself, it’s still critical that you provide him with regular interaction and playtime. Otherwise, boredom might arise out of loneliness or neglect.</p>\r\n<p>The amount of one-on-one time you should spend with your bird depends on the species and whether or not he is sharing his habitat with other birds of his species. Some birds enjoy the company of other birds, while others that are kept alone may need more quality time with you. No matter what type of bird you have, you should communicate as much as possible with him and ensure that he is able to observe you and your family so he feels like he’s a part of your flock.</p>\r\n<p>Birds need a variety of toys to keep them entertained, stimulated, to burn energy and to stay fit. Many pet parents find that regularly rotating toys allows them to continually provide their bird with exciting things to do. Choose from a variety of wood blocks, ladders, ropes, barbells and hanging toys made especially for your bird’s size and species.</p>\r\n<p>Interactive and foraging toys can provide hours of fun as well. Many pet birds enjoy playing simple games with you, like peek-a-boo. Games can encourage trust between you and your pet and provide a fun way to spend quality time together.</p>\r\n<p>When your bird is home alone, you can play soft music or leave the TV on to provide him with comforting noises—as well as interesting things to watch.</p>\r\n<h2>Biting</h2>\r\n<p>Birds use their beaks to eat and pick up items, as well as to balance and get around. It’s important to distinguish between your bird using his beak normally as a tool and using his beak to bite (for example, out of fear). Biting is simply a behavior that elicits the response your bird is trying to achieve. The key to correcting unwanted biting behavior is to determine the cause. To break a persistent biting habit, don’t reach into your bird’s habitat if he appears distressed or is flashing or pinning his eyes (rapidly dilating and contracting his pupils).</p>\r\n<p>If you do get bit, do not punish your bird. Instead, try lightly shaking or disrupting whatever your bird is standing on, be it your arm or other perch, but make sure he doesn’t fall. The slight jiggling will cause your bird to momentarily forget about biting and focus on regaining his balance. Eventually, he’ll connect biting with this unpleasant sensation and stop. </p>\r\n<p>Depending on the species, you can also try telling your bird “no” in a normal speaking voice, but never yell at your bird or use an angry tone. If you can’t determine the cause of your bird’s biting, or if you think his behavior is out of the ordinary for his personality, consult with your veterinarian to rule out any possible medical issues. You may also need to consult with a bird behavior specialist.</p>\r\n<h2>Screaming</h2>\r\n<p>Most birds are crepuscular, meaning that they vocalize during the morning and evening hours when the sun is rising and setting. This is a natural behavior and should not be discouraged. Also, a certain amount of screaming is normal for some species of bird. Excessive screaming is a behavior you’ll want to address. If fear isn’t the cause, your bird may be screaming because it causes a reaction from you. In other words, you may have inadvertently trained your bird to scream.</p>\r\n<p>If your bird is screaming because he wants attention, don’t rush into the room and tell him to stop. Instead, try to ignore him. When he eventually stops, then go to him and praise him. This way, you are rewarding his patience and quietness—not rewarding his screaming by giving him attention. You can also try covering your bird’s habitat with a towel or blanket until he stops screaming, and reward him once he stops by removing the towel or blanket.</p>\r\n<h2>Meeting your bird’s needs</h2>\r\n<p>Birds may also display certain behaviors if their basic needs aren’t satisfied—so if your bird is hungry, thirsty or tired, he may respond in a way you don’t understand. He is only behaving this way to get a desired effect—to get your attention for example. Maintain a regular schedule for your pet and make sure that he has adequate amounts of nutritious food, continuous access to fresh water and plenty of time to rest and relax. If you have a busy household that doesn’t allow your bird to get an adequate amount of sleep, he may show a change in behavior.</p>\r\n<p>It’s also possible for your bird to become bored with his variety of food, so make sure you supplement his diet regularly with bird-safe fruits and vegetables. They can be a healthy way to help spice up his life. Treats should never exceed 10 percent of your bird’s total diet. </p>\r\n<p>Fear and stress from a variety of factors can also precipitate a change in behavior. Sometimes the cure is as simple as moving your bird’s habitat to a new location that makes him feel more secure. Household noises, other pets in the house, new objects in the room—even a new brightly colored piece of apparel on one of your family members—can cause your bird to become fearful. Look for and rule out anything that may be disturbing his serenity.</p>\r\n<p>Birds need positive reinforcement just like any other pet. Reward your bird with praise whenever he exhibits positive behavior. Eventually he will begin to understand what is expected and behave accordingly. Clicker training—in conjunction with giving a treat—is another way to use positive reinforcement to teach positive behaviors.</p>\r\n<h2>Ask the experts</h2>\r\n<p>A board-certified avian veterinarian or a bird behavior specialist can help you identify causes and find solutions for changes in your pet’s behavior. Don’t expect to see results overnight. Be patient and consistent. Your efforts will ensure your bird is a happy member of your family.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 16:52:51', '2021-08-18 16:52:51'),
(36, 27, '<p>Hamsters are clever and curious companion animals that can make great pets for just about any household.</p>\r\n<p>“Most hamsters are very friendly and active,” says Dr. Sara Ochoa, a small animal and exotic veterinarian based in Texas.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you’re a first-time or experienced hamster pet parent, you may find yourself asking, “Is this a normal trait or behavior?” during the course of your pet’s lifetime.</p>\r\n<p>As a hamster parent, it’s important to understand your hamster’s behaviors and be able to identify when something might be wrong. Here is a list of normal—and not so normal—hamster behaviors that you should understand when caring for your small animal.</p>\r\n<h2>Normal Hamster Behaviors</h2>\r\n<p>The following hamster behaviors are completely normal and to be expected. If you see your hamster doing any of these things, there’s no need to worry.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Being Active at Night </h3>\r\n<p>If your hamster is awake and running around their habitat at night, have no fear—this is a sign of a happy hamster.</p>\r\n<p>“Hamsters are nocturnal animals,” says Dr. Shermaine Wilson Cox, a small animal veterinarian based outside of Atlanta, Ga. “This means they are less active during the day and more active at night. They are really energetic and will exercise for three to four hours each night.”</p>\r\n<h3>2. A Whole Lot of Chewing </h3>\r\n<p>You may notice your hamster chewing on a regular basis and could think it’s cause for concern. But chewing behavior in hamsters is a way for these small animals to file and grind down their teeth.</p>\r\n<p>“Hamster front teeth are constantly growing. Since they are always growing, they need to be filed daily,” says Ochoa. “Give them approved things to chew on. Things like wooden blocks or crunchy food are good for them to chew on.”</p>\r\n<h3>3. Stuffing Their Cheeks </h3>\r\n<p>We’ve all seen adorable videos of hamsters stuffing their cheeks with food, and this behavior is perfectly normal. Hamsters use their cheek pouches to carry and store food, says Wilson Cox, who adds that hamsters can carry up to 50 percent of their body weight in their cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>“The cheek pouches are used to transport food, bedding material, and occasionally their young,” she says. “After stuffing their cheek pouches with food, they will take it back to their burrow or special hiding place and empty the pouches into their food store.”</p>\r\n<h3>4. Burrowing and Hiding </h3>\r\n<p>Hamsters instinctively burrow or hide as a means of protection and staying safe. So, if you see your hamster hiding or burrowing in their habitat, you have no need to fret. “This is their way of hiding from any danger,” says Ochoa. “They will usually hide when they want to rest. This is how the stay safe while they sleep.”</p>\r\n<h2>Not Normal Hamster Behaviors</h2>\r\n<p>While the above behaviors are things pet parents can expect from their hamsters, the following are signs that a hamster may be sick or unwell. If you notice any of these symptoms, make an appointment to see your veterinarian.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Hibernating </h3>\r\n<p>If there is a sudden drop in temperature in a hamster’s environment, a hamster may go into hibernation. Wilson Cox explains that this often happens at a temperature of approximately 41 degrees Fahrenheit. A pet’s habitat should be kept at normal household temperatures to maintain a healthy pet (up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit), so while although may be normal for hamsters, it shouldn’t ever happen with your pet at home.</p>\r\n<h3>6. Lethargy </h3>\r\n<p>As previously mentioned, hamsters are active and energetic animals, so if you see a hamster that lacks energy or is being sluggish, have them evaluated by a veterinarian. “Any time a hamster is acting lethargic we start to worry,” says Ochoa. “Hamster’s do not show signs of sickness until they are very sick.”</p>\r\n<h3>7. Not Eating or Drinking </h3>\r\n<p>A healthy hamster should have a healthy appetite, so if your hamster is not eating or is refusing food, there may be something wrong. “With them being so small, even just a few hours without eating or drinking, they can get dehydrated very easily,” says Ochoa.</p>\r\n<h3>8. Not Chewing </h3>\r\n<p>If you notice malocclusion (improperly aligned teeth) or that your hamster’s teeth look overgrown and you don’t see your hamster chewing regularly—even if you’ve supplied proper chewing tools—this is a sign of possible concern.</p>\r\n<h3>9. Uncharacteristic Hiding </h3>\r\n<p>Hamsters do burrow and hide, but it’s mostly when they are sleeping. If your hamster is hiding constantly during regular awake or play periods, it may be a sign of anxiety or stress. “If a pet is afraid, they will usually be hiding a lot,” says Ochoa. “They may do this if a cat [or other animal] is constantly watching them.”</p>\r\n<h3>Other Signs of Hamster Sickness</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to the above behaviors that may signal a sickness or medical condition, other signs to watch for include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Cloudy, sunken, or swollen eyes</li>\r\n<li>Hair loss</li>\r\n<li>Weight loss</li>\r\n<li>Diarrhea</li>\r\n<li>Constipation</li>\r\n<li>Sneezing</li>\r\n<li>Discharge from the eyes, nose or mouth</li>\r\n<li>Heavy breathing</li>\r\n<li>Tumors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>“If you notice any of these signs, take your hamster to a veterinarian that specializes in small animals to discuss the health of your pet,” says Wilson Cox.</p>\r\n<p>To learn more about your hamster, consult a My Puppy My Pet store partner or take a look at this hamster guide for additional information.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 16:58:09', '2021-08-18 16:58:09'),
(37, 28, '<p>If you examine the label on your dog\'s food, you\'ll likely see a long list of ingredients that includes an assortment of meats, grains, fruits, vegetables, vitamins and minerals. With so much attention on gluten-free diets for humans (even for those who don\'t suffer from Celiac disease or gluten intolerance), it\'s natural to question whether a similar diet might benefit our pets. After all, if it\'s good for us, could it be good for them? Perhaps you\'ve heard of pet parents who have switched their dogs to grain-free diets and you\'re wondering whether you should do the same. Is grain-free dog food a good option for your pet?</p>\r\n<h2>Defining Grain-free</h2>\r\n<p>A grain-free diet is exactly as its name implies: a diet in which grains—including rice, corn, wheat and barley—are excluded. At first glance, it might seem like a grain-free diet would be a good match for your dog, considering his carnivorous nature and the importance of protein in a dog\'s diet. But focusing exclusively on meat and excluding grain isn\'t a sure-fire way to establish effective and balanced nutrition for your dog. Instead, focus on the bigger picture, which involves selecting food that contains ingredients of the highest quality and ingredients in the right proportion. It is also important to note that food allergies in dogs are most commonly protein sources such as beef, fish and poultry.</p>\r\n<p>Although you might assume that the top grain-free dog foods consists entirely of meat or fish, you might be surprised to discover that non-meat ingredients are often added in place of grains. Vegetables are a frequent addition, and you might find potatoes, broccoli, carrots, sweet potatoes or many other vegetables in the ingredients list of a grain-free dog food.</p>\r\n<p>And while some types of dog and puppy food are entirely grain-free, other types contain only one type of grain, or they eliminate a specific ingredient. That\'s why you\'ll see gluten-free dog food (free of wheat) or single-grain formulas that contain only one grain—oats, for example—along with the meat, vegetables and other ingredients.</p>\r\n<p>If you choose a grain-free diet, be sure to read the labels carefully. Many formulas are naturally lower in carbohydrates. However, some grain-free formulas contain carbohydrate levels that are similar to or even higher than formulas with grains. In some cases, ingredients like potatoes replace the grains and often have more carbohydrates than the common grains used in dog food. As a result, grain-free and low carbohydrate dog foods are not always synonymous with one another.</p>\r\n<p>Whether your dog\'s diet includes grain or not, your main concern must always be centered on providing a complete and balanced diet that meets all of the nutritional needs of your pet.</p>\r\n<h2>Why Some Dogs Might Benefit from a Grain-Free Diet</h2>\r\n<p>For dogs that are sensitive or allergic to a specific grain, a diet that is devoid of that particular grain can be a positive step toward improving their overall health and well-being. But in order to determine an allergy or sensitivity, you\'ll need to work closely with your veterinarian to diagnose the troublesome ingredient. Simply removing ingredients from your dog\'s diet without veterinary supervision could result in an unbalanced diet that doesn\'t provide your dog with everything he needs to thrive.</p>\r\n<p>Most importantly, you\'ll want to talk to your veterinarian about your dog\'s diet and discuss the options that will provide the most benefits for your dog\'s individual needs and circumstances. Due to the innumerable variables in age, activity level, breed characteristics and special needs that exist among dogs, a one-size-fits-all diet isn\'t feasible. So while a grain-free diet might be the perfect choice for a dog that suffers from food-related allergies or sensitivities, a grain-free diet might not suit a dog in different circumstances—such as a dog that needs to gain weight quickly. Again, your veterinarian will be able to help you make the appropriate determinations and select a diet that will provide balanced nutrition for your dog\'s specific needs.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-18 19:46:29', '2021-08-18 19:46:29');

The better the diet, the better your pet should look. One good sign is a shiny, silky coat with no dry skin.</p>\r\n<h2>Protein is Key</h2>\r\n<p>Cats are carnivores. Meat and protein should make up a big chunk of their diet. Protein can come from a variety of sources, including plant matter, so make sure the bulk of the protein is derived from meat and poultry. These ingredients are not necessarily inferior – it all depends on how the ingredients are arranged according to their amino acid profile. They also need certain essential amino acids that their bodies can\'t produce. One of the most important of these is taurine.</p>\r\n<p>A lack of taurine in the protein can cause serious health problems in cats, including cardiomyopathy (or weakened heart muscle disease), reproductive disorders, retinal degeneration or blindness. Feeding your kitty a premium food is your best insurance against taurine deficiency because premium food manufacturers make sure their brands give your cat the taurine levels needed, plus the correct balance of other nutrients.</p>\r\n<h2>Avoid an All-Meat or All-Vegetarian Diet</h2>\r\n<p>Cats are carnivores. They require high animal protein diets. A vegetarian diet will not provide adequate nutrition for your cat due to your cat\'s very specific gastrointestinal system and nutrient requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Cats must also get nutrients from foods other than meat.

Dog food doesn\'t contain enough protein or the right amino acids – including taurine – to meet your cat\'s dietary needs. No need to panic, though. If you catch your cat snacking at the dog\'s bowl, just discourage the habit and make sure they eat plenty of their own food.</p>\r\n<h2>Your Cat’s Changing Dietary Needs</h2>\r\n<p>As your kitten reaches adulthood, nutritional needs change. They\'ll need less protein and fat, and fewer calories. You can switch your cat to an adult food at age one.</p>\r\n<p>Your pet’s digestive system can handle a limited number of food types at a time if you consistently feed them the same food and treat options. They will need a short period of introduction when introducing new recipes to their palette to ensure a smooth transition for digestion.

Obesity in cats can be a real problem, and might even lead to other health risks.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, 60% of cats in the United States were overweight or obese in 2018. Obesity in cats can happen because of overfeeding, a lack of exercise, or because of other health-related factors that may cause your cat to keep weight.

Always consult with your veterinarian before switching your cat’s food, but if type of food is the problem, you might consider putting your cat on a weight management diet, or your veterinarian may prescribe a specific diet cat food formula.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>Lack of exercise</strong>: Let’s face it —cats aren’t usually the most active creatures. While it’s totally normal for your cat to spend the majority of their day lounging and relaxing, it is ideal for your cat to play for at least a half hour a day. If your cat seems uninterested in play, it may just be time to find an interactive cat toy that actually engages them.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Underlying health concerns</strong>: If your cat is already eating the recommended amount of quality food and they do seem to have enough exercise but weight is still an issue, it’s time to consult with your veterinarian. They can run some tests to ensure that the root cause of your cat’s weight problem isn’t an underlying health issue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While showering your cat with treats and food and love and affection is likely all you want to do, if your cat is exhibiting signs of weight issues, it might be time to pull back a bit. Remember, treats for your cat should only account for up to 10% of their overall diet.

Enough – and not too much – food throughout the day will ensure your fish live longer and are brighter, more colorful and more interesting to watch. If you have multiple fish sharing a tank, make sure everyone gets their fair share and the right type of food. </p>\r\n<h2>Feeding Tips</h2>\r\n<p>Breakfast, lunch and dinner: how much and how often?</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Mealtime - while it might fit your schedule best to feed your fish in the morning and at night, fish are used to eating smaller meals throughout the day. If possible, drop food in the tank two to three times a day to mimic mealtimes in the wild. </li>\r\n<li>2-minute rule - How much should your fish get when it\'s time to eat? As a general rule, feed them as much food as they can eat in one to two minutes. To determine how much that is, drop a small pinch of food into the tank and start the countdown. Now, watch how much food falls to the bottom and how long it takes the bottom-dwelling fish to eat it. If all the food is gobbled up in under two minutes, try adding another pinch. </li>\r\n<li>As long as you carefully monitor your quantity, trace amounts of uneaten food should not pose a problem. However, if it\'s more than a small amount, excess food should be siphoned out of the tank with a specially designed water-siphon vacuum after about 15 minutes. </li>\r\n<li>Schedule - if feeding your fish is a family affair, keep track of when mealtimes occur and who fed the fish last. </li>\r\n<li>Make it automatic - If you\'re out of town or if you\'d like some help keeping up with your fish\'s feeding schedule, you may want to consider automatic or vacation feeders. Automatic feeders are battery operated and can be programmed to dispense food into the tank at certain intervals during the day. Vacation feeders are available for anywhere from 3 to 7 days and are shaped like pyramids. Each level of the pyramid dissolves and releases fish food up into the tank over the course of a few days, all you do is drop it in before you leave. Some even include surprises mid-week!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Food: Too Much of a Good Thing</h2>\r\n<p>Overfeeding your fish is just as dangerous as underfeeding. Here\'s why:</p>\r\n<p>Fish will overeat. Just like humans, fish can become obese and that extra weight can take a toll on their health. Young fish can grow up with deformed bodies if they\'re overfed.</p>\r\n<p>Certain types of fish, like catfish and cichlids, are more susceptible to overeating. Understand the risks of overfeeding with your swimming species.</p>\r\n<p>Adding too much food to your tank, even if your fish aren\'t interested in eating it, can still be harmful. Excess food in your tank will eventually decay and possibly overload your tank\'s filter. As a result, water quality will suffer and your fish could die.</p>\r\n<p><strong><i>An Aquatic Buffet</i></strong><br>\r\nMany fish parents have a variety of species sharing one tank, which can make meeting dietary needs a bit more complicated. Here are some tips for fueling your fish without spurring a feeding frenzy:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Start by figuring out what types of food your fish friends eat. Are they carnivores who enjoy meat and other fish? Herbivores who devour plants and algae? Or non-discerning omnivores who eat both meat and plants? If you don\'t find out ahead of time, the decorative plants in your tank might become dinner. </li>\r\n<li>Make sure you\'re only putting good stuff — and no dangerous parasites or diseases — into your tank at feeding time. Fish food should be clean before it enters the tank. Thoroughly wash worms and scrub marine foods before they become dinner. Some fish parents won\'t use certain types of worms like tubifex, because they may carry diseases in their gut. Other parents say fish thrive on these worms and the risk is worthwhile. You have to decide what\'s right for your tank. </li>\r\n<li>Variety is the spice of life. Even if you only have one kind of fish, mixing up your fish food is vitally important. No matter how delicious a meal is, you wouldn\'t want the same meal day after day. Fish need variety in their diets, too, including proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Even carnivores need variety in the types of live food they\'re fed. Most fish will appreciate a mix of flakes, pellets, freeze dried food, frozen food and live food (for carnivores only). Vitamin supplements are also available. </li>\r\n<li>And always remember the first rule of aquariums: keep it natural. Keep species from similar environments together and be mindful of the predator and prey relationships.</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-26 14:29:59', '2021-08-26 14:29:59'),

For as small as they are, fish have specific nutritional needs that must be met in order to keep them healthy and happy. Here’s what you need to know about properly feeding your new fish.</p>\r\n<h2>What to feed your pet fish</h2>\r\n<p>A healthy fish is bright and energetic, and that begins with their diet. Keeping your fish well fed—but not overfed—is an important part of being a fish parent. Different types of fish eat different types of food. For example, carnivorous fish require meat to stay healthy. Herbivores require vegetation-based diets and algae to snack on. Omnivores require both. A varied diet is important no matter what type of fish you have. Providing all the proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals they need often means mixing the following:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Flakes</li>\r\n<li>Pellets</li>\r\n<li>Wafers</li>\r\n<li>Freeze-dried food</li>\r\n<li>Frozen food</li>\r\n<li>Live or fresh foods for carnivores</li>\r\n<li>Vitamin supplements</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Talk with an aquatics department specialist to ensure you have what your specific fish need to stay healthy as there are many forms of food that you can try.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Manufactured Fish Foods: </strong>Flakes and pellets made from cereals, vegetables, fish and special meats often have vitamins and minerals added to improve the health of your fish. Some are even formulated for specific species.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Flakes, Tablets, Pellets and Granular Forms of Fish Food: </strong>Often preferred by vegetarian fish and bottom scavengers, these types of food help regulate the amount of food given to your fish. These foods float, sink at different speeds and some adhere to the inside of glass tanks.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Live, Frozen and Freeze-dried Foods: </strong>These foods are high in protein and are good for carnivorous fish. Live food offers mental stimulus for fish but also pose the risk of introducing disease into your tank. Make sure all live foods are healthy before feeding them to your fish. Live worms must be washed carefully to remove harmful bacteria or diseases. Frozen or freeze-dried foods are often a good alternative to live food as these offer similar nutritional value and many harmful bacteria are removed during the freezing or freeze-drying process.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'storage/1629967590.jpg', 'imgbanner', '2021-08-26 14:46:30', '2021-08-26 14:46:30'),

To more closely mimic how a fish would eat in nature, strive to drop a small amount of food into your aquarium three times a day. If you’re not home to do this in person, consider a battery-operated automatic or vacation feeder that can be programmed to dispense food at intervals that you set. Vacation feeders in particular are typically able to provide scheduled meals for three to seven days.</p>\r\n<p>It’s important to keep in mind that fish will overeat when food is available, and this can be just as dangerous as eating too little. Overfeeding can lead to poor water quality as well as health concerns like bloat, digestive issues and fatty liver. The type of fish that you have can impact their feeding schedule as well. Catfish and cichlids, for example, are more susceptible to overeating, so take extra caution with them.</p>\r\n<h2>Fish feeding tips</h2>\r\n<p>Determining just how much we should feed our fish can take some practice. Use these fish feeding tips to help you keep your fish properly fed.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Utilize the 2-minute rule:</strong> A good general rule is to feed your fish as much food as they can consume within 2 minutes. Determining this will require a little experimenting. Drop a small bit of food into the aquarium and use a stopwatch to time out 2 minutes. Watch how much food falls and how long it takes your fish to consume it as it falls or hits the ground (for bottom-dwelling fish). If your fish eat everything you’ve put in within 2 minutes, add another pinch.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Monitor uneaten food:</strong> Small amounts of food left uneaten shouldn’t pose a problem, but if your fish routinely leave a large amount behind, revisit the 2-minute rule to reassess how much you’re feeding them. Remove any excess food with a water-siphon vacuum after 15 minutes. Uneaten food left in a tank can decay, causing the water quality to suffer, which, in turn, impacts your fish’s health.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Research safe foods for your fish:</strong> As mentioned above, carnivorous fish require clean meat that is free of parasites and other diseases. Certain types of live worms, like tubifex, can offer some health benefits to fish, but they can also carry potentially harmful diseases in their guts. Talk with an aquatic specialist if you need help planning a healthy diet.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Keeping your fish happy and healthy requires a lot of research into the best types of food for your particular species of fish as well as a dedication to staying on top of a proper feeding schedule and routine tank cleaning.&nbsp;</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-26 14:47:22', '2021-08-26 14:47:22'),

Although many points of ferret parenting are compared to sharing a life with other pets, ferrets do require a specialized, unique diet to maintain their highest level of health. Ferrets are obligate carnivores and require a meat-based diet that is low in fiber and high in fat and protein. There are many options of ferret food available, however some may have higher quality ingredients or higher meat content than others.</p>\r\n<p>A healthy ferret will not generally binge-feed to a point of obesity, and due to their high metabolism and short digestive tract, most ferrets will do best with having food available at all times to graze on as they wish, so free-feeding is recommended.

For growing juveniles or senior ferrets, there are commercial ferret diets that are specifically formulated with the specific needs for their life stage. Both dry and canned food can be given to ferrets, however dried food is generally preferred for adult ferrets to aid in dental health. However, canned or water-softened food may be preferred for young ferrets, those with dental issues requiring softer food, or to encourage a picky eater.</p>\r\n<h2>What Should I Feed My Ferret?</h2>\r\n<p>While there are many dietary options out there for your ferret friend, there are some foods that should be avoided. Although some sources may advise that a high-quality cat food is an acceptable diet for ferrets, the nutritional needs of ferrets do vary considerably from that of cats, so it is not an ideal, species-appropriate diet. A diet formulated specifically for ferrets is much more likely to be nutritionally balanced, however it is always a good idea to check the ingredients as not all are created equal, and those that have heavy plant-based ingredients can cause health concerns and should be avoided.</p>\r\n<p>Treats are also an important part of a well-rounded diet but should be only given in moderation and not exceed 5 - 10% of your pet’s total diet. Healthy treats include those that are meat or egg based including cooked or freeze-dried muscle or organ meat.&nbsp; Sugary, dairy or carbohydrate-rich foods should be avoided as these are difficult for ferrets to digest. Additionally, there are many types of supplements and vitamins available for your ferret, however you should always consult with your veterinarian to see if these are recommended for your individual ferret’s needs.</p>\r\n<p>Whichever high-quality diet you choose, ferrets can be notorious for being finicky eaters and may refuse to change diets or have issues adjusting to a diet change. If you need to change your ferret’s diet, it is best to do so gradually over the course of a week or longer to reduce the chances of digestive system upset for your companion.

To combat scurvy, your guinea pig needs 30–50 mg of Vitamin C daily. Pellets and treats fortified with Vitamin C should provide your guinea pig\'s daily needed intake, but there are also additional options. While you can provide Vitamin C in liquid or tablet form, these options are less-commonly used. Supplementing with treats in the form of citrus fruits and vegetables allows you to provide Vitamin C from natural sources, while still giving him the opportunity to enjoy the diversity and fulfillment that comes from a well-balanced diet.</p>\r\n<p>If you ever notice anything out of the ordinary with your guinea pig, take them to their veterinarian right away.

(57, 40, '<p>Rabbits are herbivores, so the majority of their diet should be composed of grass hay, which is rich in Vitamins A &amp; D as well as calcium, protein and other nutrients. Eating hay promotes health and should be available at all times. In addition, pelleted rabbit food and a variety of dark green leafy vegetables are an important part of your rabbit\'s complete and balanced diet. Treats, including fruit, should make up a small portion of your pet\'s diet.</p>\r\n<p>Fresh, filtered, chlorine-free water must be constantly available, especially during warmer weather, as rabbits are susceptible to heat stroke. Depending on the size of your rabbit, water intake should be about 10 ounces daily. Rinse your rabbit\'s water bottle out daily and clean with hot water and a bottle brush weekly.</p>\r\n<h2>Making Changes in Your Rabbit\'s Diet</h2>\r\n<p>As with any change in your rabbit\'s diet, you\'ll want to introduce new foods slowly and in small amounts. Rabbits are susceptible to mucoid enteritis and gastrointestinal stasis, and abrupt changes in the content of their diet can put your pet at an increased risk of developing these serious conditions.</p>\r\n<h2>Best Foods for Your Rabbit</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Hay:</strong> Rabbits require this kind of fiber for proper digestion; therefore, hay must be available at all times. Chewing on hay also helps to wear down your rabbit\'s teeth, which grow continuously. Always purchase fresh, high-quality, clean hay that is dry, sweet-smelling and free of mold. There are different types of grass hay mixtures to choose from, depending on your rabbit\'s age and specific needs. Timothy hay is a great high-quality choice for adult rabbits, while a high-quality alfalfa blend is ideal for rabbits under seven months of age. Bermuda grass, brome grass, orchard grass and oat hay are additional options for your adult rabbit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pellets:</strong> Commercial rabbit food is specially formulated to provide balanced nutrition with the ideal dosage of essential nutrients, including much-needed fiber. Choose pelleted food that is fresh and has been veterinarian-tested and approved and follow the feeding instructions on the packaging as a guide. Consult your veterinarian if you have a baby rabbit or a senior rabbit, as they have unique needs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Provide your rabbit with a variety of dark green leafy vegetables and herbs—such as kale, turnip greens, arugula, carrot tops, romaine lettuce, parsley, collard greens, bok choy and basil. Many vegetables are ideal for your rabbit, however, some should only be provided occasionally and some should be avoided. Ask your veterinarian to help you determine which vegetables you should feed your rabbit. Wash all produce thoroughly to remove dirt and traces of harmful pesticides. In addition, it\'s important to discard produce that has not been eaten within several hours.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fruits:</strong> Aim to feed fewer fruits than vegetables, due to the higher sugar content. Small, bite-sized portions (minus the seeds or pits) served occasionally will delight your rabbit. Choose from apples, pears, strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, bananas, kiwis, apricots, papayas, plums, raspberries and peaches. Again, thoroughly wash all fruits before serving them to your rabbit, and avoid serving produce cold.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Treats:</strong> Treats (including fruit) should not exceed 10 percent of your rabbit\'s total diet. Bite-sized pieces of fresh vegetables such as bell peppers, pumpkin or zucchini squash can be served as a treat. There are all kinds of healthy, all-natural treats made especially for rabbits to nibble on and enjoy. Many contain fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and other essential nutrients. However, some commercially produced rabbit treats contain artificial sweeteners, sugar or salt, so carefully read labels when selecting healthy options for your pet.</p>\r\n<p>Since your rabbit\'s teeth grow continuously, you should also provide a variety of fun chews, including sticks, toys, balls, blocks and treats that are made for rabbits and other small animals. These toys and treats are fun for your rabbit to chew on and encourage his natural foraging instincts. They also help to relieve boredom while preventing overgrowth of teeth. Another treat option is a small animal salt lick, which is a rich source of healthy minerals and is a healthy way to satisfy your rabbit\'s desire for salt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cecotropes:</strong> Nature has provided rabbits with an unusual method for supplementing their unique nutritional needs. Cecotropes are small, soft pellets that contain nutrients absorbed from plants during the digestive process. They pass from the large intestine, out the anus and are consumed immediately. While this process may look bizarre or even revolting, you must not discourage it. Cecotropes are a necessary part of your rabbit\'s diet and are not the same as the dry, round fecal pellets that they also produce.</p>\r\n<h2>Foods to Avoid</h2>\r\n<p>There are a several types of foods that you should avoid giving your rabbit, for various reasons. Some foods can be poisonous, some are too high in fat or sugar, some are a choking hazard, some have no nutritional value and some can cause gas. You can refer to books on rabbit care or reputable websites (such as the ASPCA), but ideally, you should consult an exotic animal veterinarian or a veterinarian that specializes in small animals for nutritional guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>A short list of the foods to avoid feeding your rabbit includes chocolate, iceberg lettuce (due to its low nutritional content), beans, rhubarb, fresh corn, potatoes, dairy products, bread and meat. You should never offer your rabbit any plants, flowers or grass from your yard or garden as they may contain pesticides or other hazards; many houseplants are toxic, so always supervise your little pet when he\'s out of his habitat.</p>\r\n<p>If you ever notice anything out of the ordinary with your rabbit, take him to your veterinarian right away. Signs of possible illness include weight loss, hair loss, abnormal lumps and diarrhea. Like any other pet, it\'s important for your rabbit to get annual check-ups. Consult with your veterinarian to ensure that your rabbit is getting the proper nutrition needed for a long, healthy life. With proper care, you can expect your rabbit to live up to 10 years or more, depending on their breed and size.</p>\r\n<p>(For blogs only: tagging: rabbit, rabbits, rabbit care, rabbit information, rabbit care 101, rabbit care guide)</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-26 15:58:04', '2021-08-26 15:58:04'),

We have a few tips for how to get even the fussiest of birds to eat a full and varied diet plus some information on the best food and supplements to give your feathered friend.</p>\r\n<h2>Provide a balanced diet</h2>\r\n<p>A healthy bird\'s diet should consist of 60–70% packaged food and 30–40% fresh vegetables and fruits. A quality diet of pelleted food combined with fresh vegetables, fruits and a small amount of seeds is optimal for your feathered friend. When shopping, be sure to search for bird food by the type of bird you have. This can save you time and help you avoid mistakes.</p>\r\n<p>There are a variety of nutritionally balanced pelleted diets available. Some are colorful and fruit flavored, while others are more natural. Be sure to choose the correct formula and pellet size for your bird. Some birds prefer to soak their pellets, so be sure to change their water often. In addition to providing better nutrition than a seed based diet, pellets also produce a lot less mess as there are no seed hulls littering the bottom of your habitat and the surrounding area.</p>\r\n<p>Fresh fruits and vegetables should be placed in separate dishes from pellets or seeds. Do not leave fruits and vegetables in a bird\'s habitat for more than a few hours as they spoil quickly and can cause illness. Learning the types of vegetables and fruits preferred by your bird can be one of the most rewarding parts of feeding time.</p>\r\n<p>The following foods should never be given to your bird as they can be toxic:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Chocolate</li>\r\n<li>Alcohol</li>\r\n<li>Raw meats</li>\r\n<li>Avocado</li>\r\n<li>Rhubarb</li>\r\n<li>Caffeine </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Here are a few examples of vegetables and fruits that are healthy and safe for your feathered friend:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale</li>\r\n<li>Carrots</li>\r\n<li>Orange and apple slices</li>\r\n<li>Raw broccoli</li>\r\n<li>Sprouted peas</li>\r\n<li>Sweet potatoes</li>\r\n<li>Celery</li>\r\n<li>Corn</li>\r\n<li>Strawberries</li>\r\n<li>Apricots (no pits)</li>\r\n<li>Mangoes</li>\r\n<li>Bananas</li>\r\n<li>Cantaloupe</li>\r\n<li>Grapes</li>\r\n<li>Papayas</li>\r\n<li>Pears</li>\r\n<li>Pineapple bits</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In small amounts, there are two basic types of seeds that you can feed your bird:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Cereal - Millets, canary seed, de-hulled oats. These are low in fat but high in carbohydrates.</li>\r\n<li>Oil Seeds - Sunflower, peanuts, hemp, pine nuts. These are high in fat and carbohydrates.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><i>\"Your best bet is to opt for specially prepared birdseed mixtures that are tasty and more palatable for your bird and have added nutritional value.\"</i></p>\r\n<p>While seeds are palatable, highly digestible, convenient and inexpensive, the lack of vitamins A, D, B12, calcium and protein mean that they are much better as a snack for your bird than an everyday meal. Seeds lose their nutrients with age and should only be bought in small quantities. Adding a small amount of seeds to your bird\'s regular diet will both give your pet variety and help keep them healthy.</p>\r\n<p>Another reason to feed your bird a balanced diet is to prevent them from becoming a fussy eater. If you don\'t offer your bird a variety of different foods from the very start there is a chance that they will become a malnourished \"seed junkie.\" You should work with your vet to resolve this—and stick with it. It will take time and patience, along with regular weight and health monitoring to achieve success. The effort will be worth it as your pet will be healthier and happier for it.</p>\r\n<p>The best way to reform your fussy feathered friend is to gradually expand the dietary choices—slowly increasing the amount of new food provided while decreasing the amount of seeds mixed in. If your bird doesn\'t get full on seeds, your bird should start to taste the new foods in the bowl. When converting to pellets, you might try sprinkling the pellets on top of the seeds. While working through this layer of new food, the fussy eater will eventually take in a pellet and find it to be surprisingly tasty. Another trick is to sprinkle or stuff new foods with a few seeds. For example, sprinkle a few of your bird\'s favorite seeds over a piece of fresh fruit, or hide them in a spinach leaf or broccoli flower.</p>\r\n<p>To be gentle and kind to your bird, it is best not to make them go \"cold turkey\". Withdrawing the old food and immediately replacing with the new could make your bird reject the food and not eat for a few days. It is also possible that your bird won\'t recognize the bowl of pellets as food, if it doesn\'t resemble the usual meal. Try phasing in the new foods slowly.</p>\r\n<h2>Dietary supplements </h2>\r\n<p>As a pet parent, you will often take dietary supplements such as daily vitamins, in order to help maintain a balanced and nutrient-rich diet. Of course, the ideal diet requires no supplements, but an ideal diet, for a human or a pet, is rarely achieved and you shouldn\'t feel guilty for supplementing your household\'s diets where necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately for pet parents, there has been a fantastic effort by pet food companies to design \"complete\" foods that meet all pet requirements. Commercial bird food mixes are formulated with a proper balance of nutrients without the risk of overdose or error so if you are giving your bird a balanced diet of pellets, vegetables, fruit and a small amount of seeds, your bird shouldn\'t need supplements.</p>\r\n<p>If you are considering providing additional nutrients, bear in mind that personally administering dietary supplements can be tricky. Below are some handy tips to help you out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Supplementing your bird\'s diet:</strong></p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Use a supplement specifically designed for birds or for your bird\'s particular species.</li>\r\n<li>Find a supplement product that your pet finds tasty. You may lose time and money switching from one to another, but finally getting your pet to willingly accept the supplement will make up for it.</li>\r\n<li>Add liquid drops to fresh water; unless they make the water taste really bad, your bird will be able to \"take vitamins\" as it drinks the water. Remember, water and vitamins should be changed at least once a day.</li>\r\n<li>Administer solid supplements either by crushing them and sprinkling them over pellets or seeds or by mashing them into your bird\'s fresh vegetables and fruit.</li>\r\n<li>Ensure you are giving the correct dosage of supplements to eliminate the risk of overdose.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Be diligent—missing a day of supplements may not immediately harm your bird, but repeated or prolonged lack of vital nutrients will lead to poor health, illness or even death.</p>\r\n<h2>Commercial Supplements </h2>\r\n<p>Due to the low level of nutrients available in seed-only diets, as well as nutritional requirements for different birds during various stages of their lives, there are many types of supplements for you to choose from for your bird.</p>\r\n<p>If you do decide to supplement, remember to use a supplement specially formulated for bird, for your bird\'s species and for their particular needs.</p>\r\n<p>Some Examples of Supplements to Choose From:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Vitamin &amp; mineral supplements:</strong> Round out your bird\'s diet.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Enzymes:</strong> Aid digestion and help replace natural enzymes baked out of commercially prepared foods (such as pellets).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Special supplements:</strong> Provide for one particular aspect of a bird\'s life, such as:</li>\r\n<li class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Calcium and phosphorus - For female birds during mating or breeding.</li>\r\n<li>Protein - For molting periods.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Vitamin &amp; Mineral Deficiencies</h2>\r\n<p>It is imperative that you consult a veterinarian before introducing any supplements to your bird.<br>\r\nSupplements should only be used in conjunction with a proper diet never as a replacement.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-26 16:22:19', '2021-08-26 16:22:19'),
(60, 46, '<p>While no dog parent can promise their pet that they’ll never get sick, you can help protect them&nbsp; from certain infections by keeping up with their preventive care and monitoring their environment carefully. Such is the case with leptospirosis in dogs. This infection is commonly caused when a pet comes in contact with infected water or urine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your dog has been rolling around in a dirty puddle or had contact with a wild animal, you should be on the lookout for some common signs of leptospirosis. Read on to learn more about what leptospirosis is, how your dog can get and spread it and what to do if you notice symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>What is leptospirosis in dogs?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Leptospirosis—sometimes called lepto or Weil’s disease—is a type of bacterial infection that, once in the bloodstream, can do serious damage to your dog’s liver and kidneys. The condition comes specifically from a bacterium called Leptospira.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Leptospirosis can be caused by any of many strains of Leptospira. You will most commonly see leptospirosis symptoms in dogs who drank from tainted water or whose mucus membranes came in contact with the bacteria. The bacteria can also find their way into the body via a scratch or open wound on a dog’s body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, which means it can be spread between species, including from dogs or other animals to people. It’s just as important to protect your dog against the disease as it is to make sure they don’t spread it. Dogs should be kept away from other people and pets at the first signs of leptospirosis infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, dogs often get the disease from tainted water. This can include everything from puddles and ponds to moist soil. But this isn’t the only way to encounter the bacteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Infected animals have leptospirosis in their urine, which puts any dog who comes in contact with it at risk. While your dog can be infected by other dogs, they also risk exposure by rooting through trash where an infected raccoon has urinated, playing near a rat nest or interacting with other wild or domesticated creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to the virulence of the bacteria, leptospirosis can be fairly common in dogs. Take a look at these everyday activities in which your pup could come into contact with the bacteria.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Playing in a muddy field or park where stagnant water is present&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Running through a wooded area frequented by wildlife&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Spending time in a kennel with other dogs who may be infected&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Drinking water from a puddle or body of water that other animals also visit&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Hunting or sporting situations where they retrieve wildlife&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Running through an irrigated pasture&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Should pet parents be worried?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>How common is leptospirosis in dogs? That depends on where you live. In urban areas where dogs have little contact with wild animals and are more likely to be vaccinated, the threat is not too significant. If you live in a rural area and often let your dog off leash to explore the great outdoors, however, you should familiarize yourself with leptospirosis symptoms in dogs as well as signs of Lyme disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>How can I protect my dog from leptospirosis?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>While vaccines are the top recommended way of preventing lepto in dogs, they only protect against the four most common variations of the bacteria that cause leptospirosis. Even if your pet is fully vaccinated, you’ll want to keep them away from dirty water and at-risk environments whenever possible. Avoid stagnant water outdoors, discourage your dog from interacting with unknown creatures, and keep them away from areas where the urine of other animals could be present. Thoroughly cleaning wounds and scratches also helps you minimize your pet’s vulnerability to all bacterial infections, including leptospirosis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Leptospirosis Symptoms in Dogs&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>In the early stages of leptospirosis, your dog may appear tired or lethargic and have a fever. As the infection continues, you will likely see the more serious symptoms listed below. Sadly, if leptospirosis is left untreated, it can lead to kidney or liver failure. Some dogs fight off this infection relatively quickly, however, and never experience any severe signs of illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Leptospirosis symptoms in dogs can be categorized by those you might spot on your own&nbsp; and symptoms that are only detectable by conducting a medical test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Symptoms You Can Observe at Home</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fever</li>\r\n<li>Weakness, lethargy or exercise intolerance</li>\r\n<li>Refusing food, eating less food or vomiting</li>\r\n<li>Sudden vomiting, especially when it contains blood, is a common sign of lepto in dogs.</li>\r\n<li>Heavy panting and/or trouble breathing</li>\r\n<li>Pain</li>\r\n<li>Changes in stool quality</li>\r\n<li>Increase in drinking and urination</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that these are just some of the symptoms of leptospirosis in dogs, but they are the one that are most likely to appear if your dog is infected. In any case, a combination of these symptoms is typically a sign that your pet is ill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Symptoms Observable With Testing</h2>\r\n<p>While you may notice symptoms of lepto using your knowledge of your dog’s normal behavior and habits, a definitive diagnosis requires a vet’s expertise. Specifically, your vet can test your dog’s blood and urine for the presence of the bacteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A DNA-PCR test is a rapid test that can detect the DNA of Leptospira in your dog’s blood or urine. The presence of this bacteria’s DNA is often the most definitive sign that your dog has leptospirosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Your veterinarian may also choose to do a full chemical blood profile to help rule out other illnesses or detect other bacteria. A blood test can also detect kidney and liver values issues, a common indication of leptospirosis in dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>A full urine panel—also called a urinalysis—allows your vet to look for bacteria under a microscope. It can also allow them to detect additional illnesses and rule out other types of bacteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>A microscopic agglutination test—or MAT for short—looks for antibodies. When your dog is infected, their body creates antibodies against the Leptospira bacteria found in their blood. A high level of antibodies is a good indicator that your dog currently has an infection. If they have lower levels of antibodies, it may mean they previously had the disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your veterinarian can usually identify the bacteria quickly—particularly with the PCR test. Treatment can begin as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Common Treatments for Leptospirosis in Dogs</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to leptospirosis in dogs, treatment is fairly straightforward. The most common and effective treatment is the use of antibiotics. Thankfully, this type of bacteria can be quickly killed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Your veterinarian may recommend several stages of antibiotics. A common protocol includes two rounds of antibiotics, with the first&nbsp; addressing the acute, immediate infection your dog is facing. The second phase of antibiotics helps address any low-grade, lingering infection that may remain after the first round of treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to antibiotics, your veterinarian may also recommend fluid therapy. This treats any dehydration that your dog is experiencing. They may also prescribe an anti-vomiting medication to help them keep down food and water until the antibiotics kick in. Multivitamins can also help keep your pup’s immune system strong and help them recover more easily.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the seriousness of your dog’s infection, you may need to complete up to four weeks of treatment. While this may sound scary or time-consuming, it ultimately helps eliminate the bacteria and signs of lepto in dogs. Protecting your dog often means safeguarding your entire family, given that the bacteria can spread from dogs to people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Final Advice&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>We recommend getting your dog vaccinated to help protect them against leptospirosis. My Puppy My Pet offers vaccination services in both&nbsp;vet hospitals&nbsp;and at&nbsp;vaccination clinics.&nbsp;Leptospirosis is uncommon among city dogs, but you may have reason for concern on camping trips or while spending time in wildlife areas. If you live in the country, it’s wise to be aware of leptospirosis symptoms in your pet. If your dog spends time in a wet, marshy area or decides to take a drink out of a puddle, stay vigilant and contact your vet for advice.&nbsp;</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-27 18:18:55', '2021-08-27 18:18:55'),

Most of these products need to dry for 24 hours before your pet should be allowed to come into contact with them. Dogs can be very inquisitive when it comes to new smells as well, so store insecticides and pesticides out of reach. The most dangerous pesticides include snail bait, fly bait, mole or gopher bait and rat poison.</p>\r\n<p>Gardens thrive on compost. Dogs do not. Coffee grounds, moldy food, and certain kinds of fruits and vegetables can be toxic to your dog. Keep compost bins fenced off and unreachable for the tail wagging set.</p>\r\n<p>When doing yard work, be cautious where you store your gardening tools. Rakes, tillers, hoes, and trowels can be hazardous to dogs. Since they are curious animals, dogs will want to sniff, lick and touch garden tools. But tools can also cause trauma to sensitive body parts and dogs aren\'t always coordinated and agile enough to get out of the way of a falling tool.</p>\r\n<p>Be aware that grass seeds have sharp points that can poke eyes and lodge in ears and noses.

As pets get older, the cartilage in their joints begins to deteriorate.</p>\r\n<p>“Cartilage is adversely impacted and wears away,” says Rossman. “Normally the cartilage can act as a cushion; however, in these instances, dogs can experience significant pain when running, walking, or getting up from a lying or seated position.”</p>\r\n<p>While all types of dogs can be affected by arthritis, larger dogs tend to suffer from arthritis more often than smaller breeds. “The Great Dane, Saint Bernard, Labrador Retriever, and German Shepherd are most commonly affected,” says Rossman.</p>\r\n<p>Dogs that are overweight are also more likely to develop forms of arthritis due to the pressure added weight puts on their joints. “Being sedentary and/or overweight puts excess strain on joints and can lead to arthritis,” Rossman adds.</p>\r\n<p>Dogs with a congenital condition called hip dysplasia may also develop severe forms of arthritis as they age.</p>', 'storage/1630067144.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-08-27 18:25:44', '2021-08-27 18:25:44'),

While you should aim to brush your dog’s teeth at least 1–2 times per week, you can also supplement with other dental care measures. “Pets, just like people, should have some form of a daily dental routine,” says Miller. “While brushing daily is ideal, you cansimplify it by giving a dental treat, water additive or using a dental wipe on days you can’t get to brushing.”</p>\r\n<h2>How to brush your dog’s teeth</h2>\r\n<p>Brushing your dog’s teeth at home can feel like a challenge at first. But these tips can help to make the experience comfortable for you and your pet.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Get the right dog tooth-brushing tools</h3>\r\n<p>When brushing your dog’s teeth at home, the first things you need are a pet-friendly toothbrush and a pet-safe toothpaste. Since pets don’t know how to spit out toothpaste, human toothpaste is not suitable for pets. Toothpaste used for human mouths contains fluoride, which can upset your dog’s stomach, and may even contain xylitol, which is toxic to dogs. Lommer recommends using products specifically designed and formulated for dogs.</p>\r\n<p>“Pet-safe toothpastes are different from human toothpastes in that they don\'t have foaming agents, are safe to swallow and are flavored to appeal to pets,” she says. Flavors including poultry, beef, seafood and peanut butter will definitely make a pet happier to have their teeth brushed.</p>', 'storage/1630068181.png', 'imgbanner', '2021-08-27 18:43:01', '2021-08-27 18:43:01'),
(67, 49, '<p><a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/dog/dental-care/toothbrushes-toothpaste\"></a>For smaller dogs, try a pet toothbrush that fits on the end of your finger—it can be much easier to maneuver within their mouths. Larger dogs respond well to larger toothbrushes with a handle, as it can be easier to reach their back teeth.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Try a test run</h3>\r\n<p>Once you have the right tools, it’s important to do what you can to get your pet familiar with the toothbrush. Before you attempt to use it, get your dog comfortable by regularly lifting up their lips and offering them rewards for good behavior. Incorporate rubbing your finger or a dental wipe along their gum line to get your dog used to having something in their mouth. The more comfortable your dog is with being handled, the easier the tooth-brushing experience will be. Once they become familiar with&nbsp; the toothbrush, start with short brushing sessions and gradually increase the time as they become more comfortable. You should be able to brush all their teeth in one sitting.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Get in a comfortable position</h3>\r\n<p>Most dogs will squirm and try to get away when you attempt to brush their teeth. 38 percent of pet parents who don’t brush their pet’s teeth say it’s because their dogs won’t sit still for the time needed to brush. Lommer recommends positioning your dog in a way that it’s easier for you to hold them in place.</p>\r\n<p>“For small dogs, either wrap them in a towel like a burrito or sit next to them on a couch. Then wrap your elbow around their body and bring them close to your side to help keep them still while you are working with their head,” Lommer says. When brushing a larger dog’s teeth, sit next to them and wrap your arm around their head, supporting their chin. In this position, you can use your hand to help move&nbsp; their mouth to best brush their teeth.</p>\r\n<p>Never force a dog to stay if they are visibly upset or uncomfortable, because this can lead to negative associations with brushing, Lommer says. Instead, if your dog starts fidgeting too much, let them go and try again later. Lommer says that it’s crucial to be careful with how you restrain or hold your&nbsp; dog. “...Proper restraint is important, as their attempts to evade often involve tossing the head around, and neck injury could result,” she says.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Go for the gum line</h3>\r\n<p>Rather than opening your dog’s mouth all the way, Lommer recommends lifting your dog’s lip and focusing on where their teeth meet the gum line.</p>', 'storage/1630068281.png', 'imgSquare', '2021-08-27 18:44:42', '2021-08-27 18:44:42'),
(68, 49, '<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">While brushing toward the front of your dog’s mouth may be more acceptable to them, it’s best to focus your efforts on their back teeth where plaque and tartar build up. “The salivary ducts empty at the sides of the mouth onto the outside surfaces of the upper back teeth, so starting there is best,” Lommer says. Target this area with small, circular motions when brushing your dog’s teeth.</span><br></p>\r\n<p>Make sure to strike the right balance between brushing too hard and being too gentle. Lommer says that many pet owners don’t scrub hard enough or spend enough time brushing to really remove plaque buildup. “Just like our own mouths, the more time you spend, the more effective plaque removal you\'re accomplishing,” she says.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Continue the upkeep</h3>\r\n<p>While brushing at least a couple times per week is essential to maintaining your dog’s dental health, you can supplement care between brushings with dental treats or chews for dogs, water additives and dental wipes. These treatments help reduce plaque buildup but aren’t enough on their own to maintain your dog’s oral health, so you will still need a regular brushing routine.</p>', 'storage/1630068332.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-08-27 18:45:32', '2021-08-27 18:45:32'),

However, if the chore is made easier for you and your dog, it’s sure to happen more often. When it comes to making dog tooth-brushing easier for your dog, Lommer says to not underestimate the power of praise. She says that praising your dog while you’re brushing their teeth can go a long way in helping your dog feel comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>Another way you can make the experience less stressful is to choose the right time to do it. Brushing your dog’s teeth after playtime or mealtime when their energy is low may help.

By performing these five steps and having the right bathing supplies on hand, you\'ll avoid some unsuspecting pitfalls.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Brush and remove mats</strong> — Before any washing takes place, brush your dog and check for mats. Long-haired or double-coated dogs need to have mats or excess loose hair brushed out before bathing. If not, the mats become tighter and more difficult to remove and may have to be clipped out by a professional.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Prepare the washing area</strong> — Cover the bottom of the bathing area with a non-slip surface such as a bath mat. Make certain the sink, tub or shower is clean and free of soap or other residues.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Find the right shampoo</strong> — Make sure the shampoo you have selected is right for your dog\'s coat. If you\'re using a spot-on flea product, avoid flea shampoos and read the label to ensure the flea protection won\'t wash out with shampoo. You may need to re-apply after the bath, once the coat is dry.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Get your dog situated</strong> — Keep a leash on your pet so they can\'t take off when bath time is underway. This could turn into a mess, or even a danger with a slippery, wet dog on the loose.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clean your canine\'s ears</strong> — Using an ear cleaner gently wipe around the perimeter of the ear. Do not go down into the ear canal as you risk injuring your dog. Let your dog shake their head a few times and put cotton balls in both ears to help prevent water from getting down into the canal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Can You Use Human Shampoo on Dogs?</h2>\r\n<p>It\'s no secret that getting your pup ready for bath time can be a task on its own.

While human and dog products may seem interchangeable, the different pH balances in our skin play into how dogs are affected by human products. Human skin has a pH balance that is on the acidic side of the acidity-alkalinity spectrum which means using human shampoo on your pup, whose skin has a more neutral pH balance, could expose them to parasites, viruses, and bacteria.

While stinky and unpleasant to deal with, keep in mind that your dog is not in any danger after they’ve been sprayed, but they could be feeling a little unsettled. It can be stressful to deal with a dog that has been sprayed by a skunk when you aren’t prepared, though, so consider being ready at a moment’s notice to handle the situation with these easy steps.</p>\r\n<h2>10 steps to get rid of skunk smell on your dog</h2>\r\n<p>When a skunk sprays your dog, take a deep breath (away from your stinky dog, of course) and get ready to fix the issue. When left untreated, skunk odor can last up to three weeks, so you’ll want to follow these steps immediately to make everything more comfortable for you and your pet.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Avoid giving your dog a bath right away</strong>. It will likely be your natural instinct to bathe your dog immediately, but bathing right away without the proper deskunking tools will actually set the oils contained within a skunk’s spray into your dog’s coat, making removal more difficult.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Keep your pup outside</strong>. Although your dog may have been spooked by their unpleasant run-in with a skunk, try to contain them outdoors while you prep their bath time. This will keep the scent from entering your home and transferring to other surfaces.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Grab a deskunking product</strong>. Dog deskunking shampoos are your best bet for getting rid of that skunk smell. These products are specially formulated to break down skunk oils, as opposed to just masking or covering them up with other smells.\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>If you don’t have a deskunk shampoo available, you can try an at-home remedy until you have time to pick one up at the store. A mixture of 1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide, 1/3 cup baking soda and 1 teaspoon of liquid dishwashing soap can be tried as a DIY swap.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Have bathtime supplies ready. </strong>In addition to your skunk shampoo, get gloves for you, a washcloth, towels, a cup or gentle hose nozzel and your dog\'s normal bath supplies.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Identify where your dog was sprayed. </strong>You\'ll want to treat the area sprayed first, so know where your dog was sprayed. Typically, this will be in teh face or near their backside.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Apply the product to your dog carefully</strong>. Taking care to avoid your dog’s eyes, saturate their coat in the area where they were sprayed. If your dog was sprayed in the face, saturate a cloth with the deskunking product and then rub that into their muzzle or cheeks, rather than directly spraying their face. Massage the product all the way into your dog’s skin and let it sit for five minutes. Wear gloves to avoid getting the skunk smell on your own hands, since the oils in the spray will make it difficult to remove from your skin.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Massage, wait and rinse</strong>. Most products recommend leaving letting the deskunking shampoo sit for about five minutes, but check the product you purchased to make sure. If your dog becomes impatient during this time, try to distract them&nbsp; by practicing a few cues and tricks while treating them. After the allotted time, massage the shampoo into their coat thoroughly to help remove all of the oil and rinse out the product.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bathe your dog with regular dog shampoo</strong>. After you have used a deskunking product on your dog, you will still need to administer a “normal bath” using your standard dog shampoo.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dry your dog thoroughly</strong>. Be sure to completely dry your dog off after each bath. Try keeping your dog outside as they dry to keep any oils that may remain out of your home.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Repeat if needed</strong>. If your pet still smells the next day, you may need to repeat the process. However, overbathing your dog could lead to discomfort, so ensure that you have properly cleaned other items in your home that your dog could have come into contact with and may be causing the scent (for example, pet bedding and upholstered items).</li>\r\n</ol>', 'storage/1630395938.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-31 13:45:38', '2021-08-31 13:45:38'),

If, however, some of that skunk smell does make it into your house, there are some things you can do to help. Boiling vinegar in a pan is one DIY way that has been found safe and effective against removing skunk smell inside. Even just setting open containers of vinegar in the rooms that smell (out of the way of pets and kids that can tip them over or drink from them, of course) can also help, because the vinegar will absorb the odors over a couple of days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Liquid bleach can help remove the smell from hard, outside surfaces like your deck and porch, but be sure to dilute the bleach in water first (one cup of bleach in a gallon of water works well), and try a small test area since it can cause discoloration.

While it’s not possible to avoid them completely, there are some things you can do to make your yard less appealing for skunks. For example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Close all trash and recycling cans and remove outside food bowls</strong>. Skunks love to dig through trash for food, so remove any temptations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pick up fallen fruit from trees</strong>. Skunks love fruit, so they’ll enjoy coming into your yard to eat the fruit that’s fallen from your trees or bushes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Avoid letting your dog outdoors unsupervised from dusk to dawn</strong>. Skunks are crepuscular, which means they choose to be out at dusk, dawn, moonlit nights and cloudy days. While accompanying your dog into the cold backyard for their last potty break before bed may seem like a hassle, it’s much better than having them come back after meeting a skunk!</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clear out potential hiding spots</strong>.

(76, 50, '<p>It’s one of every dog parent’s worst fear — you’re enjoying a great evening when, bam — your dog is sprayed by a skunk. While stinky and unpleasant to deal with, keep in mind that your dog is not in any danger after they’ve been sprayed, but they could be feeling a little unsettled. It can be stressful to deal with a dog that has been sprayed by a skunk when you aren’t prepared, though, so consider being ready at a moment’s notice to handle the situation with these easy steps.</p>\r\n<h2>10 steps to get rid of skunk smell on your dog</h2>\r\n<p>When a skunk sprays your dog, take a deep breath (away from your stinky dog, of course) and get ready to fix the issue. When left untreated, skunk odor can last up to three weeks, so you’ll want to follow these steps immediately to make everything more comfortable for you and your pet.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Avoid giving your dog a bath right away</strong>. It will likely be your natural instinct to bathe your dog immediately, but bathing right away without the proper deskunking tools will actually set the oils contained within a skunk’s spray into your dog’s coat, making removal more difficult.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Keep your pup outside</strong>. Although your dog may have been spooked by their unpleasant run-in with a skunk, try to contain them outdoors while you prep their bath time. This will keep the scent from entering your home and transferring to other surfaces.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Grab a deskunking product</strong>. Dog deskunking shampoos are your best bet for getting rid of that skunk smell. These products are specially formulated to break down skunk oils, as opposed to just masking or covering them up with other smells.\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>If you don’t have a deskunk shampoo available, you can try an at-home remedy until you have time to pick one up at the store. A mixture of 1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide, 1/3 cup baking soda and 1 teaspoon of liquid dishwashing soap can be tried as a DIY swap.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Have bathtime supplies ready. </strong>In addition to your skunk shampoo, get gloves for you, a washcloth, towels, a cup or gentle hose nozzel and your dog\'s normal bath supplies.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Identify where your dog was sprayed. </strong>You\'ll want to treat the area sprayed first, so know where your dog was sprayed. Typically, this will be in teh face or near their backside.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Apply the product to your dog carefully</strong>. Taking care to avoid your dog’s eyes, saturate their coat in the area where they were sprayed. If your dog was sprayed in the face, saturate a cloth with the deskunking product and then rub that into their muzzle or cheeks, rather than directly spraying their face. Massage the product all the way into your dog’s skin and let it sit for five minutes. Wear gloves to avoid getting the skunk smell on your own hands, since the oils in the spray will make it difficult to remove from your skin.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Massage, wait and rinse</strong>. Most products recommend leaving letting the deskunking shampoo sit for about five minutes, but check the product you purchased to make sure. If your dog becomes impatient during this time, try to distract them&nbsp; by practicing a few cues and tricks while treating them. After the allotted time, massage the shampoo into their coat thoroughly to help remove all of the oil and rinse out the product.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bathe your dog with regular dog shampoo</strong>. After you have used a deskunking product on your dog, you will still need to administer a “normal bath” using your standard dog shampoo.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dry your dog thoroughly</strong>. Be sure to completely dry your dog off after each bath. Try keeping your dog outside as they dry to keep any oils that may remain out of your home.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Repeat if needed</strong>. If your pet still smells the next day, you may need to repeat the process. However, overbathing your dog could lead to discomfort, so ensure that you have properly cleaned other items in your home that your dog could have come into contact with and may be causing the scent (for example, pet bedding and upholstered items).</li>\r\n</ol>', 'storage/1630396412.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-31 13:53:32', '2021-08-31 13:53:32'),
(77, 50, '<h2>How to get rid of skunk smell in your house</h2>\r\n<p>You’ll want to make sure that your dog stays outside in a safe area after being sprayed by a skunk until you’ve treated them with the appropriate products. If, however, some of that skunk smell does make it into your house, there are some things you can do to help. Boiling vinegar in a pan is one DIY way that has been found safe and effective against removing skunk smell inside. Even just setting open containers of vinegar in the rooms that smell (out of the way of pets and kids that can tip them over or drink from them, of course) can also help, because the vinegar will absorb the odors over a couple of days.<br>&nbsp;<br>Liquid bleach can help remove the smell from hard, outside surfaces like your deck and porch, but be sure to dilute the bleach in water first (one cup of bleach in a gallon of water works well), and try a small test area since it can cause discoloration. If the smell doesn’t disappear completely right away, have a little patience — it may take several attempts with either of these methods before it’s gone completely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Some pet skunk shampoos also work as a deskunking product for home items and can be used on carpets, clothing, bedding, kennels and other hard surfaces. When you’re purchasing a product, read the label to see what other uses it may work for.</p>\r\n<h2>How to keep skunks out of your yard</h2>\r\n<p>One of the easiest ways to handle a skunk attack is to avoid having it happen in the first place. While it’s not possible to avoid them completely, there are some things you can do to make your yard less appealing for skunks. For example:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Close all trash and recycling cans and remove outside food bowls</strong>. Skunks love to dig through trash for food, so remove any temptations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pick up fallen fruit from trees</strong>. Skunks love fruit, so they’ll enjoy coming into your yard to eat the fruit that’s fallen from your trees or bushes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Avoid letting your dog outdoors unsupervised from dusk to dawn</strong>. Skunks are crepuscular, which means they choose to be out at dusk, dawn, moonlit nights and cloudy days. While accompanying your dog into the cold backyard for their last potty break before bed may seem like a hassle, it’s much better than having them come back after meeting a skunk!</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clear out potential hiding spots</strong>. Skunks are always on the lookout for places to sleep or nest with their young, and they can get into some surprisingly small areas. Clear out any piles of wood or debris in your yard, and close up any house vents.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Being sprayed by a skunk can happen to anyone and any pet but being prepared with the proper solutions and plan of attack can help you alleviate the problem quickly.

(79, 51, '<h2>Seven Key Areas My Puppy My Pet Groomers Pay Close Attention to:</h2>\r\n<p><strong>1. Eyes:</strong> A pet\'s eye color should be bright. If a pet\'s eyes are dull in color or have a green or yellow discharge, there may be an underlying issue such as an allergy, infection or something more serious. Bloodshot eyes could signal a health concern as well. However, a dog under stress may have bloodshot eyes, so it\'s important to evaluate the situation and determine how long the condition has been present.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Ears:</strong> It\'s natural for a pet to have an odor to their ears, but when the odor is strong, that’s when you should be concerned. Ears that are swollen, tender, and have discharge are also worth having a veterinarian examine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Teeth:</strong> Groomers look for old, decaying teeth and swollen gums, which could be signs of gum disease. But when teeth look healthy and the gums are puffy, it may signal another underlying health issue.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/s/dog-grooming\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\r\n<p><strong>4. Nose:</strong> Look for changes in texture and color. A prolonged dry, cracked nose, particularly with the loss of pigmentation, scabs or open sores, calls for veterinarian care as soon as possible. Contact sensitivity and nasal discharge are also signs your pet needs attention.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Underside:</strong> Swollen anal glands can be a sign that they need to be expressed. If a pet has a negative reaction when touched, have a veterinarian examine the area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Skin and Coat:</strong> Groomers run their hands along the pet\'s body to check for bumps, scrapes, lumps, hot spots, warts and matting. Lumps on dogs or other growths can be a sign of cancer. Have a veterinarian examine any raised surface to know what you’re dealing with.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Nails and Pads:</strong> Cracked pads typically result from irritants, diet or rough terrain, and are not always indicators of a more serious problem. At the same time, a veterinarian should see your dog if you, or your pet stylist, notice any of these changes.</p>\r\n<h2>What to Do if You Notice Warning Signs</h2>', 'storage/1630397026.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-31 14:03:46', '2021-08-31 14:03:46'),

(81, 52, '<p>Unlike us pet parents, cats do not trim or chew their nails due to scary movies or stressful workdays. Your cat\'s natural urge to scratch is based around grooming and habit, and when a cat scratches items around the house with their nails, they do so to peel off old claw sheaths and expose new claws. Believe it or not, scratching also helps a cat mark their territory and stretch stiff muscles.</p>\r\n<p>If your kitty is using your furniture as their personal nail file, there are a few ways you can help discourage this behaviour:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Minimize potential damage</strong><br> By trimming your cat\'s nails every two weeks, you can minimize the damage their scratching can do to your furnishings. This doesn\'t completely solve the problem, but a little cut does go a long way. If you are unclear on how to trim your cat\'s nails you can contact your veterinarian or call the My Puppy My Pet Grooming Salon.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Provide attractive alternatives</strong><br> Training your cat to scratch in appropriate areas from an early age can act as your best defence from unwanted scratching. Here are some tips to help make it easier:<p></p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><i>Scratch post texture:</i> When it comes to scratching surfaces, all cats have different preferences. So, before you spend money on a certain scratching post, it\'s wise to give your cat some test options. Think of it as carpet samples, but for your cat\'s scratching pleasure. The most common and popular cat scratch surfaces are cardboard, carpet and sisal (a ropy fiber) so keep that in mind when picking up test samples. Once your cat has picked their preferred material, be sure to purchase a sturdy post so your kitty can dig in and pull without danger of knocking it over.</li>\r\n<li><i>Scratch post location:</i> When picking a final spot for your scratch post, pick a location close to your cat\'s favourite scratching and napping areas. Try to reinforce the idea that this is the appropriate scratching area by moving your cat\'s paws up and down the post, or scratching it yourself.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Discouragement</h2>\r\n<p>There are a few ways you can make pieces of furniture less attractive to your kitty. One of the best techniques is to spray pet repellent on your furniture, while also enticing your cat to use the desired scratching area through catnip bribes. Be warned, some repellents can leave stains, so always test these out beforehand.</p>\r\n<p>Another technique is to temporarily cover furniture with plastic, foil or carpet runners. Double-sided tape can also be an inexpensive solution for this technique because cats hate the sticky feeling. Never use duct tape.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Encouragement</h2>\r\n<p>Remember to give your cat positive reinforcement for their good behaviour too. Whenever they scratch the post, or even show interest in it; praise your cat with treats and affection. These small rewards can go a long way toward instilling good behaviour.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 14:07:57', '2021-08-31 14:07:57'),

(84, 54, '<p>Cats are self-groomers by nature, with tongues that act like tiny combs to clean and smooth their coats. However, there are rare occasions where giving your cat a traditional bath is necessary. Keep reading to learn how to determine when your cat needs to be bathed and the proper technique so you can <em>lather, rinse and repeat</em> without suiting up in a coat of armor or leaving your cat with lingering nightmares.</p>\r\n<h2>Do cats need baths?</h2>\r\n<p>In general, cats don’t need regular bathing the way dogs do. Their natural self-grooming habits do the trick on everyday dirt, but trickier situations—such as a cat who has been outside in the mud or sprayed by a skunk—require more drastic measures. Long-haired cats also may need baths more frequently because debris can become stuck in their coats, and overweight or disabled felines often need help cleaning the areas they can’t reach. As a rule, if it seems that the mess exceeds your cat’s grooming abilities, they will require a bath.</p>\r\n<h2>How to wash a cat: Tips and preparation</h2>\r\n<h3>Getting ready to bathe a cat</h3>\r\n<p>Once you have decided to bathe your cat at home, stock up on all the essentials. You’ll need pet shampoo and conditioner (or a two-in-one product), a good brush or comb, a non-slip mat, a towel and lots of treats. Never use human shampoo on your cat, as the formulation is unsuitable for cat skin and hair, and may even contain ingredients toxic to felines.</p>\r\n<h3>Pre-bath preparation</h3>\r\n<p>It is well-known that cats aren’t exactly water-lovers, and bath time can bring out defensive behavior in your pet. Trim your cat’s nails before you get started to protect yourself from unhappy claws. Give your cat a thorough pre-bath brushout to detangle their fur and remove any mats. A matted cat should not be bathed; instead, contact a professional groomer or veterinarian who will have the right tools to help your cat’s matted fur.</p>\r\n<p>Lay out your shampoo, mat and towel before you get started, then adjust your sink or tub’s water to be the same temperature you would use to wash a baby. Be sure the bath isn’t too hot, as cats can overheat easily.</p>\r\n<h3>Bathing your cat</h3>\r\n<p>Use the showerhead or nozzle to gently spray your cat, working from the rear and moving forward, avoiding their face. Next, lather your cat’s entire body (again, avoiding the head), following instructions on your shampoo bottle. Rinse all the soap off your cat completely, and provide lots of praise during the process.</p>\r\n<p>Dry off your cat using a clean towel, absorbing as much moisture as possible. Use the damp towel, or cat eye and ear wipes, to wipe the area around their face. Reward your cat with treats to create a positive association with bath time.</p>\r\n<h2>How often should you bathe a cat?</h2>\r\n<p>So long as they are in good health and you are diligent about brushing their coat, your cat shouldn’t need baths on a regular basis—nor do they want them! Got an especially messy situation on your hands, or just not ready to take on washing your cat alone? Many local My Puppy My Pet Grooming Salons can take care of a tough job! Just be sure that your cat is up-to-date on their vaccinations and ensure you check to see if your local My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;can take on a new cat grooming appointments.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 14:14:13', '2021-08-31 14:14:13'),
(85, 55, '<p>Just like with other pets, such as dogs, birds, ferrets and guinea pigs, keeping your rabbit’s nails trimmed is important for their overall foot health. Long, overgrown nails are more likely to get caught on things which can lead to painful injuries if the rabbit yanks a snagged nail. Overgrown nails also can affect the way the foot touches the ground, causing it to turn sideways, which can lead to foot related bone and joint issues if left long term. Compared to maintained nails, overgrown nails are an elevated risk to you or anyone who handles your rabbit as they are more likely to cause a significant wound if your rabbit scratches you. Although trimming your rabbit’s nails may seem like a daunting task, taking the proper steps can help make the task as stress free as possible for both you and your rabbit.</p>\r\n<h2>Supplies Needed for Trimming Rabbit Nails</h2>\r\n<p>First, before removing your rabbit from its habitat, ensure you have all the necessary supplies for the task. A towel can be a great way to safely secure your rabbit and prevent injury to you or your pet. Proper nail clippers designed for cats or small mammals are inexpensive and preferred over human nail clippers because the shape of the blade is rounded to match the shape of the nail. The rounded blade will make a smoother clip and apply less pressure to the nail than a human clipper which has a flat blade meant for flat nails. Last, Kiwk Stop is an important tool to always have when trimming nails. This powder will quickly stop bleeding should you accidently trim a nail too short.</p>\r\n<h2>How to Cut Rabbit Nails</h2>\r\n<p>Once you have gathered all your supplies, it is time to get your rabbit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Restraining a Rabbit for Nail Clipping</h3>\r\n<p>Wrapping a towel around your rabbit snuggly, securing all the legs but one, is an easy and safe way to restrain your pet and prevent them from kicking or panicking. The towel will help your rabbit feel safe and secure and keep the other three feet you are not working with tucked away.</p>\r\n<h3>Trimming Your Rabbit’s Nails</h3>\r\n<p>When looking at the foot, you should see a darker, or more opaque part of the nail at the base and in the middle a clearer part of the nail extending out further. The opaque part of the nail is called the quick which is where the blood supply to the nail is and cutting this should be avoided to prevent bleeding. Although the quick can be more difficult to see in darker nails, holding a flashlight to the nail may help make it more visible. Clipping the tip of the nail at a diagonal angle away from the nail will help reduce the chance of accidently cutting the quick. If you do accidentally cut too far and the nail bleeds, apply some Kwik Stop to the nail and give your bunny a small break. Closely monitor for the bleeding to stop before proceeding to the next nail.</p>\r\n<h3>Filing Rabbit Nails as an Alternative to Clipping</h3>\r\n<p>Some rabbits may tolerate filing of the nails better then clipping, or your rabbit may learn to accept both clipping and filing. While filing is not as efficient at removing length, it is a way to get the nails trimmed with less risk of cutting the quick if you are not comfortable with clipping. Filing also helps smooth any sharp edges which can reduce the severity of scratches both to you and your rabbit.</p>\r\n<p>When starting out trimming your rabbit’s nails, it will be best to start slowly and reward behavior so that your rabbit associates the nail trims as a positive interaction. With your rabbit’s first nail trim, you may only want to trim a nail or two at a time and then give your bunny a break and a treat before moving to the next few nails. Eventually, once your rabbit is calmly accepting several nails being trimmed without a break, you can work your way up to one whole foot at a time or even finishing all nails on both front feet and then back feet. Treats will be an important factor in helping your rabbit make the positive association that nail trimming will bring rewards.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 14:18:23', '2021-08-31 14:18:23'),
(86, 56, '<p>As a devoted pet parent, your cat\'s health is important to you. You undoubtedly know all of the intricacies of your cat\'s personality—her habits, her favorite things and her \"pet\" peeves. And while you might think that you automatically recognize all of the signs of a healthy cat, it\'s not a bad idea to reacquaint yourself with the basics. Here are the basic indicators of a happy, healthy cat:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Bright eyes:</strong> Your cat\'s eyes should be clear, alert, free of discharge and evenly focused. Additionally, her third eyelid should not normally be visible.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clean ears:</strong> Healthy ears are clean and free of odor, scabs or discharge.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clean nose:</strong> Your cat\'s nose should also be clean and free of discharge. Your cat should not be sneezing frequently or have a persistent runny nose.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Good appetite:</strong> It\'s a good idea to observe your cat\'s eating habits over a 24-hour period as a baseline to gauge his appetite in the future. If you know the specific amount of food that your cat consumes each day, it will be easier to notice if he ever exhibits a decrease or increase in appetite. Similarly, you\'ll want to regularly observe your cat\'s drinking habits to ensure that he\'s staying hydrated.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Healthy skin and coat:</strong> Your cat\'s skin should be free of scabs, redness or signs of flea infestation, and his fur should display all the signs of good health: it should be fluffy and shiny without matting or patches of hair loss.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Normal behavior and routine:</strong> The status of your cat\'s litter box offers good insight into your cat\'s health. Is he urinating and defecating in regular amounts and at regular intervals? Is he playing and napping normally and following a general routine? Deviation from a regular routine could indicate a problem.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Normal temperature and heart rate:</strong> The heart rate for a cat can range from 110 to 240 beats per minute, while normal body temperature (taken rectally) in an adult cat ranges from 100 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Regular veterinary exams are the best way to track your cat\'s vitals.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ideal weight:</strong> While obesity in cats is widely understood to be less-than-ideal, a cat that is too thin is also not optimal. Talk with your veterinarian about the healthiest weight for your cat’s age, size and breed, then work together to achieve that goal if your cat is significantly over or under that benchmark. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Happy disposition:</strong> A happy cat is playful, athletic, interested and alert. As a pet parent, you know your cat\'s inherent disposition better than anyone, so you\'ll easily recognize any deviations from his regular activities and level of playfulness. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Annual checkups can help to detect anything out of the ordinary. If you notice anything unusual with your cat, schedule a visit to the veterinarian for an exam.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 14:26:11', '2021-08-31 14:26:11');

(87, 57, '<p>Fleas are much more than just a nuisance. In just 30 days, 10 fleas can become an infestation of up to 250,000 on your pet and in your home, and they can leave your pet an itchy, tired mess — or worse. There are several steps tell if your cat has fleas and how to prevent fleas on your cat and in your home. Here’s everything you need to know to get the job done quickly and safely.</p>\r\n<h2>How to tell if your cat has fleas</h2>\r\n<p>There are several common signs that a cat might be suffering from a flea infestation, but it will take some investigating on your part to be sure. Fleas are very small — only about 1/12 – 1/16” long — which means when there’s only a handful of them, they aren’t that easy to spot. Plus, their reddish-brown color may blend in with your cat’s fur. Rather than focusing on spotting fleas visually, be on the lookout for these other common signs that your cat has fleas:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Itchy skin and excessive scratching</strong>: Although fleas can grow in numbers quickly, it doesn’t take very many of them to send your cat on a scratching spree. Besides the overall movement of the flea across your pet’s skin, your cat may also be allergic to flea saliva, which turns it into an irritant that causes sensitivity, itchiness, scratching and even small scabbed bumps on their skin.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Excessive biting on fur and legs</strong>: Besides scratching, your cat may resort to biting or gnawing at their fur, legs or feet in an effort to gain some relief.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Patchy hair loss, especially near the tail or neck</strong>: The saliva from even one flea could cause an allergic reaction that leads to hair loss, not to mention any fur that’s removed by your cat’s own biting or scratching.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Lethargy</strong>: A single flea can bite its host hundreds of times a day, sucking blood each time. In severe cases, where there are many fleas biting your pet, this blood loss can lead to anemia. Lethargy is a common symptom of this.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Visual cues</strong>: Once the fleas start to multiply, you may begin to see them. Look for light-colored specks in your pet’s coat or on their bedding (these are flea eggs), or black, pepper-like black in their coat or on their bedding (this is flea feces). You could also see the darker insects scurrying around within your pet’s coat.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Flea-related problems</h2>\r\n<p>Fleas cause more than just a low-level itchiness in your cat — they can lead to serious medical problems and, as such, should be taken very seriously. Consult your veterinarian&nbsp; immediately if you think your cat may be suffering from any flea-related issues. Keeping your cat on a flea prevention medication is essential to keeping these medical issues at bay. Some common flea-related issues in cats include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Flea allergy dermatitis</strong>: Some pets are allergic to flea saliva, which leads to severe irritation, itchiness and aggravation when bites occur. You can tell if your cat is suffering from flea allergy dermatitis if small scabs and redness at the bite site appear, or if there is excessive hair loss. Secondary infection at the bite site can also occur. If your pet already has other allergies, they may be especially at risk for flea allergy dermatitis.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Treatment</em>: Removing all existing fleas in your home and yard and keeping your cat on a prevention medication will help alleviate your cat’s symptoms. Your veterinarian may also prescribe steroids or antibiotics to help relieve itch.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tapeworms</strong>: If your cat happens to ingest a flea that is carrying a tapeworm larva, the tapeworm will develop and grow in your cat’s intestinal tract. If your cat has tapeworms, they’ll appear like small pieces of rice around the anal region of your cat or in their feces.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Treatment</em>: Make a visit to your veterinarian as soon as possible for treatment if you think your cat has tapeworms. Your vet will recommend a deworming treatment and what ongoing preventative measures your pet should follow.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Flea-bite anemia</strong>: When a severe flea infestation occurs and your pet has a large number of fleas feeding on them for extended periods of time, they are at risk for flea-bite anemia. Especially if your cat is very young, be on the lookout for signs of lethargy.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Treatment</em>: Flea-bite anemia can be fatal, and may require blood transfusions, iron supplementation or even hospitalization. It’s essential to visit the veterinarian immediately if your cat has become very lethargic, especially if they are younger than 12 weeks old.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Although there may be treatment methods for these flea-related health issues, you can help your cat avoid them-with an over the counter flea medication or one prescribed by your veterinarian.</p>\r\n<h2>How to get rid of fleas on cats</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/c/best-flea-treatment\"></a></p>\r\n<p>Getting rid of the flea infestation in its entirety and avoiding further infestations is your best defense when it comes to helping your cat avoid flea-related problems. There are several things you can do to keep treat a current infestation and keep new ones at bay.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Treat your pet</strong>. Begin your flea-riddance process by treating your pet and all their things, including pets that don’t appear to be suffering from fleas.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Flea and tick collars for cats help kill fleas, flea eggs, flea larvae and ticks immediately as well as repel fleas</li>\r\n<li>Topical treatments and shampoos also help kill adult fleas, flea eggs and lice, as well as prevent the hatching of new fleas</li>\r\n<li>Flea pills and chewables are a fast-acting way to kill fleas and provide symptom relief</li>\r\n<li>My Puppy My Pet Grooming Salons offer flea-relief solutions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Treat your home</strong>. It’s essential to not only treat an infected pet, but to also treat your home. If you ignore your home, fleas will find their way onto your pet and the cycle will repeat itself.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Clean and wash all of the bedding in your home, and use a spray or powder on the upholstery and carpets</li>\r\n<li>Routinely wash all your pet’s bedding</li>\r\n<li>Vacuum the entire home, including hardwood floors, upholstered furniture (including the bottom of furniture), carpets and rugs; remove vacuum bags and throw them out after each use to prevent flea eggs from hatching in them</li>\r\n<li>If needed, contact a professional flea exterminator company to help</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Treat your yard</strong>. One of the best defenses against fleas is to keep your cat indoors. However, if you do let your cat out, or if you have other animals that may bring in fleas from outside, you’ll want to be especially sure that you’ve treated your yard for fleas, as well. That includes keeping the lawn trimmed at all times and using a yard spray that kills fleas around the perimeter of your home.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our cats tend to be quiet sufferers, so it’s especially important to pay attention when they are acting differently, and to be aware of the signs that a flea infestation might be occurring.

(91, 59, '<p>Chinchillas hail from the mountains of Chile, but these adorable, fur-covered rodents are also popular pets in U.S. households.</p>\r\n<p>Taking care of a domestic, pet chinchilla requires dedication from pet parents to ensure that these small animals live healthy lives.</p>\r\n<p>“Chinchillas have a relatively longer life span compared to other rodents—10 to11 years,” says Dr. Meliasa Robinson, a veterinarian at Saint Francis Veterinary Center of South Jersey. “Despite their natural shyness, chinchillas can be rewarding pets with a playful nature.”</p>\r\n<p>Here are some essential tips for providing the best care for your chinchilla.</p>\r\n<h2>Chinchilla food and diet</h2>\r\n<p>Proper care of your chinchilla starts with a well-balanced diet. Because chinchillas are small animals, pet parents have to be cognizant about keeping them at a healthy weight to avoid associated medical problems.</p>\r\n<p>“I recommend feeding a diet high in fiber, which makes hay a major component of the chinchilla diet,” says Robinson. “Commercial pellets are also available for chinchillas to provide additional vitamins and nutrients.”</p>\r\n<p>Robinson adds that alfalfa hay is not suitable for adult chinchillas and that feeding a chinchilla too many pellets can lead to intestinal issues. She recommends a set amount of pellets—about 2 to3 tablespoons—per day.</p>\r\n<p>“Items such as grains, apples and carrots are considered treats and should be limited to prevent upsetting the stomach,” says Robinson. “To help keep your chinchilla at a healthy weight, make sure hay is the primary portion of the diet (70 to75 percent), limit pellets to 10 percent of the diet, fresh vegetables to 10 percent and the remainder treats.”</p>\r\n<h2>Chinchilla housing recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>Another important part of caring for your chinchilla is setting up the proper environment to keep your pet safe, comfortable and entertained.</p>\r\n<p>“Chinchillas are very agile and acrobatic—thus, they require larger housing than say a guinea pig,” says Robinson. “Large multi-level [enclosures] that provide climbing and jumping opportunities are ideal. Be sure to provide an area for hiding, just in case your chinchilla is feeling shy.”</p>\r\n<p>Chinchillas come from a natural high-altitude environment that is dry and cool. For this reason, you’ll want to prevent your chinchilla’s room from becoming overly humid or hot during warmer weather.</p>\r\n<p>“Make sure the area of the habitat is not too hot,” says Robinson. “Chinchillas are sensitive to heat, and temperatures greater than 80 degrees Fahrenheit can cause heat stroke, which can be fatal.”</p>\r\n<p>Chinchillas release excess heat through their ears, so if your chinchilla is getting too hot you may notice the skin in their ears becoming red, with visible red veins. Keep your pet cool and make sure they always have access to fresh, clean, chlorine-free water.</p>\r\n<p>Chinchilla habitats should be cleaned and disinfected at least once per week. Rinse the habitat and allow it to dry completely before placing your pet back inside. Additionally, pet parents should change chinchilla bedding at least once per week and remove wet spots from the habitat on a daily basis.</p>\r\n<p>You can let your chinchilla out of their habitat as often as you would like, as long as you supervise your pet closely. Robinson says that frequent handling of chinchillas can help you build a bond with your pet.</p>\r\n<p>When removing your chinchilla from their habitat, consider doing so in a smaller room or space. “Keep in mind that your chinchilla may want to hide at times, so being in a large open space could be stressful,” Robinson adds.</p>\r\n<h2>Chinchilla baths and grooming</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to grooming, chinchillas are relatively low-maintenance pets. They need access to a dust bath a couple times per week, but pet parents do not need to physically groom chinchillas.</p>\r\n<p>“Commercial dust baths are available,” says Robinson. “Provide a pan that is large enough for your chinchilla to roll in and is 2 to3 centimeters deep. Make sure your chinchilla does not excessively use the dust bath, as this can cause eye problems.”</p>\r\n<p>Because of the density of chinchilla fur, regular water bathing (the way you might bathe a dog or cat) is not recommended, as it can be very difficult for the fur to dry, and this can lead to bacterial or fungal issues.</p>\r\n<p>Although chinchillas do not require regular brushing, pet parents can use a soft brush to lightly comb a chinchilla’s fur during regular handling sessions.</p>\r\n<h3>Caring for your chinchilla’s teeth</h3>\r\n<p>A chinchilla’s teeth grow continuously throughout their life, and malocclusion (misaligned teeth) can occur at any time. Regularly examine your chinchilla’s teeth for developing problems.</p>\r\n<p>“The best thing that can be done for your chinchilla’s teeth is to feed an appropriate diet and find a veterinarian who has experience seeing chinchillas,” says Robinson. “An examination is recommended at least annually, and in an older chinchilla, every 6 months may be needed.”</p>\r\n<p>Pet parents can offer chinchillas store-bought chew sticks or mineral chews to help file down their teeth.</p>\r\n<p>Keep a close eye on your chinchilla’s behaviors and eating habits. If your chinchilla is dropping food, not eating well or is drooling excessively, it’s time to see your veterinarian. Additionally, says Robinson, smaller than normal stools may be an indication of a dental or dietary issue that needs veterinary attention.</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding normal chinchilla behavior</h2>', 'storage/1630402023.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-31 15:27:03', '2021-08-31 15:27:03'),

Pet parents should provide hiding areas in their habitats so that chinchillas can escape for a little alone time.</p>\r\n<p>These small pets are active, and they love to jump and play. Chinchillas are</p>\r\n<p>nocturnal, meaning that they sleep most of the day and are awake and energized at night. Pet parents should not be concerned if they see their pets sleeping a lot during the day.</p>\r\n<p>Chinchillas may also be vocal in certain situations. “Chinchillas do make distinct vocal sounds based on response to certain situations and context,” says Robinson.</p>\r\n<p>Pet parents should watch for any changes in their chinchilla’s behavior such as lethargy, distressed or labored breathing, an unsteady gait or disinterest in their surroundings. These could be indicators of an underlying medical problem.</p>\r\n<p>“Decreased appetite, lethargy, drooling, palpable swelling on the bottom jaw, weight loss and small stool are red flags,” adds Robinson. “If any of these signs are noted, be sure to bring your chinchilla to a veterinarian right away. Make sure your veterinarian is comfortable seeing chinchillas.”</p>\r\n<p>Just like many small animals, chinchillas can make great pets if you are ready for the commitment and understand the care they need.

(93, 60, '<p>Guinea pigs are, by their very nature, happy and enthusiastic, and their charming antics and sweet noises are incredibly endearing. But how can you tell if your guinea pig is truly happy in your home? Read on to learn some of the best ways to ensure your guinea pig\'s happiness.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Home sweet home</h2>\r\n<p>Make your guinea pig happy by providing them with a lifestyle conducive to good health. According to the Humane Society of the United States, guinea pigs are social animals who prefer being in the company of another guinea pig. For this reason, you may wish to consider adding a pair of guinea pigs to your family rather a single guinea pig. Obviously, to prevent the arrival of unexpected babies, you\'ll want to make sure that your guinea pig pair consists of two females, two males, or guinea pigs that have been altered (spayed or neutered). While spaying and neutering eliminates the possibility of unexpected baby guinea pigs, it\'s important to find an experienced veterinarian who is capable of performing these delicate operations on guinea pigs. Always remember that guinea pig pairs must be raised together, as they may fight if introduced as adults, and male guinea pigs may have an increased tendency to argue.</p>\r\n<p>While companionship can be achieved through the presence of a second guinea pig, guinea pigs can also thrive living by themselves as long as you, the pet parent, provide personal attention on a daily basis. Spend time with your guinea pig and enjoy their company. Guinea pigs are intelligent animals that have an impressive capacity for learning, so take the time to interact with them, play games, and teach them new things. You\'ll both enjoy the opportunity to bond!</p>\r\n<p>Your guinea pig\'s habitat is another factor in their overall happiness. Opt for a large habitat that offers plenty of room for your guinea pig to safely live and play. Provide ample bedding and keep the habitat as clean as possible by regularly changing the bedding and removing wet spots. Position the habitat so that it is out of direct sunlight and away from drafts—guinea pigs don\'t appreciate temperature extremes. (The Humane Society of the United States recommends an average temperature of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit for guinea pigs.)</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Plenty of fun</h2>\r\n<p>Guinea pigs love to hide! In addition to a safe habitat, they also appreciate accessories such as a hide box or nesting box. Guinea pigs also enjoy a variety of toys, and a chew stick for proper dental maintenance. Additionally, guinea pigs thrive on a daily schedule, so aim for regular times for exercise and feeding.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>A happy guinea pig</h2>\r\n<p>A healthy guinea pig is a happy guinea pig.

(94, 61, '<p>Exercise is important to the health of your guinea pig. Without exercise, your guinea pig can grow to be very docile and timid. Guinea pigs are also prone to boredom, so it’s important to create new ways to keep them active and occupied.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Natural Behavior</h2>\r\n<p>Reportedly domesticated some 10,000 years ago, guinea pigs have a lovable charm and it’s no wonder that these critters have become a popular pet for children. What many people don’t know is that guinea pigs are not far removed from their wild cousins, the cavy. To truly understand a guinea pig, you must first examine their natural behavior and basic instincts:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li><strong>Pack Animals</strong> <br>\r\nLike dogs, guinea pigs are pack animals that are highly social. They rely on each other for companionship, and in the wild, they live in herds with continuous interaction. Naturally, a lack of companionship can make them stressed and grouchy. Guinea pigs love to play with each other and are best suited being raised in same-sex pairs from the time they are very young. Playing and interacting with your guinea pigs on a daily basis will help make up for their lack of companionship. Guinea pigs also enjoy routine, so playing with them and feeding them at the same time each day will lessen their stress. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Bundles of Energy</strong> <br>\r\nYoung guinea pigs are particularly energetic, and if you leave them enclosed in a habitat all day, they will become frustrated and depressed. Make sure you have a playpen, or a guinea pig-proofed room with no other animals present where your little buddy can stretch out while being supervised.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Intelligence</strong> <br>\r\nWhile some may write these creatures off as mindless, they are quite intelligent. For instance, guinea pigs speak their own coded language, and love the spotlight. Notions that guinea pigs are untrainable are pure myth. With a little patience and persistence, you can teach your guinea pig a few new tricks. Plus, time spent training provides your sensitive little one with the attention and companionship he needs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Behavior in the Home</strong> <br>\r\nYour guinea pig innately loves to burrow and explore, and to an extent, it’s important that you let him do so freely. Before bringing a guinea pig into your home, decide where he can and cannot go before letting him roam. A guinea pig-proofed room or a playpen are essential for daily exercise. Teach your children about your pet’s sensitive hearing and the importance of gentle handling. Community-like living is crucial for guinea pigs, and once spirited children are involved in your pet’s life, there’s a very real possibility that they will develop a pack of their own.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Tips for Raising a Health, Happy Guinea Pig</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Always approach your guinea pig in a quiet, non-intimidating manner.</li>\r\n<li>Clean your guinea pig’s habitat and environment daily. They are obsessively clean and will become distressed when neglected.</li>\r\n<li>Train your guinea pig to do tricks for treats. They love to be center stage, and are fantastic performers.</li>\r\n<li>Provide chew toys to satisfy your guinea pig’s urge to chew and to help maintain healthy teeth.</li>\r\n<li>Lap time is also important bonding time for you and your guinea pig, but does not replace the mental stimulation and exercise he gets from running around during playtime.</li>\r\n<li>When your guinea pig is very excited or happy, you may witness an entertaining feat called “popcorning,” where he jumps up and down or runs around quickly, oftentimes accompanied by cute squealing noises. This behavior resembles a mini bucking bronco and is fun to watch, but know that not all guinea pigs will do this.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Fun Activities to Try</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Set up an obstacle course made of tubes and switch it up every week or so.</li>\r\n<li>Provide your guinea pig with cardboard boxes, paper towel rolls or toilet paper rolls (maybe filled with hay or healthy treats) to play with.</li>\r\n<li>Offer a variety of appropriate and safe cat toys. Try sitting on the floor with your guinea pig and rolling balls to him.</li>\r\n<li>Use high-quality healthy guinea pig treats to teach your friend how to come when called. You can even try teaching your pet to sit up before treating.</li>\r\n<li>PVC pipes come in several configurations and can be a lot of fun for your guinea pig. Make sure they are appropriately sized for your pet.</li>\r\n<li>Soft sounds are great tools for training your guinea pig. Use a bell to signal feeding time, and soon your guinea pig will react to the sound.</li>\r\n<li>Clothes, leashes and soft small animal brushes are also available for guinea pigs to encourage more grooming, attention and interaction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Safety is important when it comes to guinea pig playtime. Carefully check for any loose pieces, sharp edges or anything else that could harm your guinea pig or be a choking hazard. Supervise your guinea pig during playtime, and explore new ideas to keep his interest. Plenty of exercise, a high quality diet and lots of love and attention will help keep your guinea pig happy and healthy.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 15:29:56', '2021-08-31 15:29:56'),
(95, 62, '<p>If you have researched pet insurance, you probably found many options that cover major accidents and illnesses. But you may be left wondering if there is anything you can do to help offset the cost of general vet visits, treatment and routine veterinary care.<br> <br>The good news for all pet parents, even those with older pets or those who have hereditary conditions, is that some insurance companies that offer pet insurance also provide wellness rewards (reimbursement) as an add-on to cover routine visits and procedures. But is the extra cost really worth it?</p>\r\n<h2>What are pet wellness plans and what do they cover?</h2>\r\n<p>Pet wellness plans can be purchased on their own or added to an existing insurance policy. These plans provide coverage for routine care including regular exams, medications and standard procedures. Since standard pet insurance policies cover things like accidents, injuries and serious illness only, wellness rewards can help with routine expenses. While many insurance companies require you to also purchase a regular pet insurance policy in order to get wellness coverage, there are other options through veterinary hospitals and other companies that offer wellness plans as a standalone offering.</p>\r\n<h3><br>Preventive and routine care coverage for pets</h3>\r\n<p>You may be wondering about a pet insurance that covers vaccinations and neutering. If that is the case, adding a pet wellness plan to your coverage is likely what you are looking for. The point of a <a href=\"https://www.petinsurancequotes.com/compare/pet-wellness-plans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wellness plan</a> is to make sure your pets have access to affordable preventive and routine care. By definition, these services are planned and predictable, so most of what is covered are things that your pet actually needs. Here is a sample of some of the services that might be covered with a wellness plan:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wellness exams</li>\r\n<li>Spay and neuter surgery</li>\r\n<li>Deworming </li>\r\n<li>Vaccinations</li>\r\n<li>Routine blood tests</li>\r\n<li>Microchipping</li>\r\n<li>Grooming</li>\r\n<li>Medicated shampoos</li>\r\n<li>Nail trimming</li>\r\n<li>Anal gland expression</li>\r\n<li>Pet activity monitors</li>\r\n<li>Obedience training</li>\r\n<li>X-rays</li>\r\n<li>Teeth cleaning</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Always be sure to ask your pet wellness plan provider, or those you are considering, for the exact list that they cover, as each plan and company will vary on what is included.</p>\r\n<h2>Is pet wellness insurance worth it?</h2>\r\n<p>Whether a pet wellness plan added to your pet\'s insurance is worth the cost depends on how much you spend per year on routine pet care. A wellness plan helps you stay on top of your pet\'s health by encouraging routine care. For example, if you know your wellness plan covers dental cleaning and nail clipping, you’re more likely to make sure these things get done - benefiting your pet’s overall health and potentially saving you from more costly treatments later.</p>\r\n<img src=\"//assets.petco.com/petco/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/resource-center-pet-insurance-dental-care-600w-400h\" class=\"center-block img-responsive\" style=\"width:auto;\" alt=\"vet dental exam on dog\">\r\n<p>While every plan is different, pet wellness plans are usually a good investment for pet owners who spend $400 to $500 per year on preventive and routine care for their pet. However, it is important to keep in mind is that there are limits to these plans. For example, if you have a plan that tops off at $500 per year, anything over that will have to be paid out of pocket. Some companies offer different levels of wellness coverage, and you can even change it every policy year as your pet gets older. <br> &nbsp;<br>Pet wellness plans also help spread out the cost a bit. If you have trouble affording a $50 annual checkup and an additional $200 for boosters and blood tests at the same time, wellness insurance covers the same visit but allows you to make small, affordable monthly payments instead of worrying about coming up with a large chunk of money or putting the costs on a high-interest credit card.<br> <br>Wellness plans are also a good investment if you have a puppy or kitten because they usually require more frequent wellness visits and vaccinations as well as spay and neuter surgeries.

(97, 63, '<p>One of the best indicators of a healthy pet is healthy skin and a lustrous, shiny coat. Alternatively, there are a number of medical and behavioral issues that can cause your pet to lose their hair. How can you tell if your dog, cat, rabbit, ferret or other pet is simply shedding or if there is a health issue that needs immediate attention? Learn how to recognize the various causes of hair loss so you know when to treat at home and when to call your veterinarian.</p>\r\n<p>Hair loss on your pet can appear as bald patches (called alopecia) or areas of thinning hair. In general, hair loss caused by hormonal diseases is symmetric (the same on both sides of the body), while most other hair loss is asymmetric.</p>\r\n<p>Hair loss in pets can be attributed to a variety of causes, including:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Nutritional deficiencies</li>\r\n<li>Seasonal shedding</li>\r\n<li>Over grooming</li>\r\n<li>Allergies</li>\r\n<li>Illness or disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Nutritional Deficiencies</h2>\r\n<p>A high-quality, complete and balanced diet (with nutrients such as proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals) is one of the most effective ways to maintain your pet\'s healthy skin and coat. Provide your pet with a diet that best meets their specific needs. With your veterinarian\'s recommendation, supplements may be given to help make up for certain nutritional deficiencies or to give an extra boost to support healthy skin and coat.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Seasonal Shedding</h2>\r\n<p>All pets shed as they react to changing photoperiods as well as temperatures but for the most part, indoor pets shed less, while outdoor pets lighten their coat more in response to changing seasons. It\'s important to establish a regular and thorough grooming routine, using products that promote skin and coat vitality. Grooming also prevents matting, which can trap moisture and bacteria next to your pet\'s skin and cause irritated, itchy patches.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a small animal that doesn\'t require much help with pet grooming, observe their habits so that you know when there are any changes, and take note of anything out of the ordinary to report to your veterinarian.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Over grooming</h2>\r\n<p>Occasionally, stress, anxiety, boredom or being left alone can cause pets to overgroom themselves or a helpless bystander. Urgent medical attention is required if:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Your pet\'s scratching, licking or biting comes on suddenly and severely.</li>\r\n<li>There is inflammation or hair loss, or if his efforts break the skin.</li>\r\n<li>Your pet has other symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting, pain, lethargy, coughing, difficulty moving, changes in appetite or difficulty breathing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Allergies</h2>\r\n<p>If excessive licking is causing hair loss it could be because of allergies to food (mostly to proteins), to inhaled allergens (such as pollen), or to contact allergens (such as grass and carpet cleaners).</p>\r\n<p>An allergic reaction to flea saliva is one of the most common causes of hair loss in pets (because of the itching). Your pet\'s indoor and outdoor environment should be managed year-round for fleas and ticks. Regularly examine your pet\'s coat for parasites and, if a problem is found, consult your veterinarian to determine the severity and the best way to treat it.</p>\r\n<p>Pets allergic to pollen should stay indoors when it is windy or during the early morning and evening hours, when the pollen count is highest. Consider rinsing or wiping your pet\'s feet and body with water or wipes after bathroom breaks and outdoor playtimes. Vacuum your house regularly, especially areas frequented by pets and places where dust mites like to accumulate.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Illness or Disease</h2>\r\n<p>In some cases, hair loss can be caused by an underlying illness or disease, including: </p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n<li>Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism</li>\r\n<li>Arthritis</li>\r\n<li>Skin infections caused by bacteria, fungus or yeast</li>\r\n<li>Skin diseases caused by immune system disorders</li>\r\n<li>Cancer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Incessant scratching, hair loss, ear infections and open lesions can be the result of diseases of the skin. If your pet is licking to excess or losing more hair than usual, consult your veterinarian.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>When to Call Your Veterinarian</h2>\r\n<p>Your pet needs immediate care if you notice patchy or excessive hair loss; if your pet\'s skin develops sores or appears dry, red or inflamed; or if you notice other signs of illness such as parasites, lethargy, appetite loss, itching or excessive licking that goes beyond normal grooming.</p>\r\n<p>Your veterinarian will ask you about the duration and frequency of licking or scratching and whether your pet exhibits any other symptoms. After a thorough exam, your veterinarian may recommend skin scrapings, a blood test, a urinalysis, a fungal culture or a skin biopsy, food trials or skin testing. Depending on the cause of your pet\'s hair loss, therapy may include antibiotics, antifungal ointments, medicated ointments and shampoos or antiphrastic medication.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Prognosis</h2>\r\n<p>Healthy, normal skin and fur is critical to your pet\'s well-being. Because there are so many issues that can cause hair loss, your veterinarian may need time to reach a diagnosis. Some conditions require long-term care, but most pets recover fully and soon regain their lustrous coats. Allergies to food and the environment as well as autoimmune disorders require more long term management.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 15:37:56', '2021-08-31 15:37:56');

Co-pays may vary, reimbursement may work differently, and one company may have restrictions that another doesn’t. There are a lot of things to keep in mind, but it is important to understand what is and isn’t covered in your pet insurance plan before you decide on a policy. To ensure you know what is covered by the pet insurance provider you’re considering, be sure to compare different options and read&nbsp; each individual coverage documentation.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>What isn’t covered by pet insurance?</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering pet insurance, it’s important to keep in mind any exclusions that may apply to your pet. Every insurance company is different, so you really have to be diligent when making a decision. Some pet insurance exclusions include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Age limits</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Some pet insurance companies have age limits for coverage, but in some cases it may be a little more reasonable than you think. There are insurance companies that will cover any senior cat or dog. Bear in mind, however, that premiums for an older pet may be higher than those for a younger pet so it’s generally better to choose an insurance plan while your pet is younger, if you’re able to.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Pre-existing conditions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Some companies may </span><strong>not cover any pre-existing conditions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while others are more flexible.

My Puppy My Pet pet insurance plans do not cover pre-existing conditions that occur or show symptoms on or before the first date of coverage or during a waiting period (the time it takes for coverage to begin after you sign up).</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Breed-specific conditions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Although an insurance company might not exclude your pet from coverage, it may cost a little bit more to cover a breed known to have specific health problems. Purebred pets&nbsp; may also be a little more costly to insure because they have a higher risk of inherited health issues.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, every company is different and requirements for what is and isn’t covered may vary.</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Do I need pet insurance?</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve only ever had healthy pets, you may think pet insurance is a waste of money.

(99, 65, '<p>When trying to enjoy your aquarium there can be nothing more distracting than a cloudy tank. But why did this happen and what caused it to occur? Unfortunately, it might not be a straightforward answer and could be driven by several things. Most of these contributors are easy to rectify but a few may take a little more persistence to resolve. We first need to determine if the water has a white/gray, brown, or green appearance in order to apply the appropriate solution to rectify the discoloration. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Why is My Fish Tank Cloudy?</h2>\r\n<p>If this is a new aquarium setup, one contributor to that cloudy appearance could be coming from the substrate you are using. In freshwater aquariums, although most substrates are epoxy coated, all substrates need to be thoroughly rinsed. Substrates for marine aquariums can be extremely dusty and if not thoroughly rinsed, can cause cloudy water. A best practice is to rinse the substrate in smaller quantities to provide a thorough rinsing. If substrate rinsing is skipped, the combination of dust and water can coat the aquarium glass, giving the appearance of a cloudy tank.</p>\r\n<p>Cloudy water can also be caused by the water being used. Tap water can contain items like heavy metals, nitrates, phosphates, and silicates. Ensure that you are utilizing a tap water conditioner as many conditioners will neutralize items like chlorine and chloramine, ammonia, and heavy metals. There is also the option of purchasing prepackaged aquarium water or you can choose to purchase a reverse osmosis system. RO filters will help to remove most contaminates from your tap water supply.</p>\r\n<p>After starting a new aquarium, it is not uncommon for the aquarium to become cloudy. This is due to beneficial, nitrogen converting bacteria colonizing to oxidize ammonia and nitrites. This bacteria bloom can also occur in an established aquarium if there is a sudden increase in nutrients. The increased nutrients spark a growth of heterotrophic bacteria. These bacteria break down fish waste, decaying plant debris, and unconsumed food into ammonia. They also create a slimy bio film that will form on decorations and walls of the aquarium. Because the heterotrophs multiply quickly, their explosion in population can cause the water to become cloudy. For a new aquarium with no aquatic life, allow the aquarium to progress through this cycle naturally. In a mature aquarium, reducing the amount of food, completing a water change and cleaning your substrate will help to lower the nutrients in the tank. The addition of live plants can also assist with lowering nutrient levels.</p>\r\n<h2>Brown and Green Discoloration</h2>\r\n<p>Brown water certainly takes away from the beauty of your aquatic life and could have been innocently caused by the addition of a popular aquatic décor- driftwood. &nbsp;If the driftwood was not presoaked prior to adding to the tank can cause a slight brown coloration to the aquarium. This coloration comes from the release tannic acid. This will start clear up with regular water changes and using chemical filtration, like carbon will aid in clarify the water. If driftwood has been added and you are noticing some brown coloration you should test your pH level since tannic acids can lower pH.</p>', 'storage/1630403652.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-31 15:54:12', '2021-08-31 15:54:12'),

Green water is a bloom of algae cells called Euglena. These planktonic algae cells contain flagella giving them mobility, allowing them to swim closer to the light for photosynthesis. These organisms are both auto- and heterotrophic. Autotrophs can produce their own foods whereas heterotrophs cannot. These algae are always present but will only bloom out of control if something disrupts the equilibrium in the aquarium. Overstocking aquatic life, too much light, high phosphates and excessive nutrients can cause disruptions in water quality. Not only is there concern over the discoloration to the water, but this algae will also deplete oxygen levels at night. Unfortunately, just completing a water change is not enough to rid an aquarium of green water. Reducing nutrients (overfeeding and overstocking), turning off aquarium lights, and ensuring there is no direct sunlight will help prevent these algae from overpopulating. The addition of plants can help reduce nutrients like, nitrates, phosphates, and ammonia. If you have a bloom, the use of a micron or diatomic filter can strip the cells from the tank and utilizing UV filtration will kill these cells, reducing their population and green discoloration of your aquarium water. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With an understanding of the components that affect water quality, you can take steps to prevent and address cloudiness and discoloration, allowing you to view the beauty of your aquatic life in crystal, clear water!</p></div>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 15:54:33', '2021-08-31 15:54:33'),

One thing you don’t want to see, however, is a fish that is spending a lot of time right near the surface of the water—perhaps gasping—and in apparent distress.</p>\r\n<h2>How do fish breathe?</h2>\r\n<p>A fish may linger near the surface because he’s trying to breathe more easily. Remember, fish breathe <i>dissolved</i> oxygen—not oxygen that is already combined in the H2O molecule. Naturally, these dissolved oxygen levels tend to be higher near the surface, where interaction between air and water takes place. A fish that is not receiving enough oxygen will try to compensate by gravitating toward that area. Similarly, you may notice your fish lingering near the bubbles of your air stones or other bubble-producing décor.</p>', 'storage/1630403828.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-31 15:57:08', '2021-08-31 15:57:08'),
(102, 66, '<h2>What to do if your fish are staying at the top of their tank</h2>\r\n<p>An individual fish might not be getting enough oxygen because of a problem with his gills, such as gill flukes, parasites or injury. However, if you notice that multiple fish are trying to breathe at the surface of your aquarium or staying at the top of the tank, then it\'s likely that something is wrong with the conditions of your habitat. Be sure to check, and rectify, the following factors to ensure the health of your fish:</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Poor water quality</h3>\r\n<p>Begin your troubleshooting process by performing a water test to rule out any issues with water quality (such as temperature, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, hardness, salinity levels or pH levels). Next, try to determine other reasons your aquarium may be lacking oxygen. For example, if the water in your fish tank is cloudy or polluted, you may be overfeeding your fish, or you may have a dead fish in the tank. In either case, you will need to replace as much water as is needed to bring your tank conditions back into a healthy balance (typically up to one-third of the water is recommended).</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Overcrowding</h3>\r\n<p>An overstocked aquarium—with too many fish polluting the water and competing for the same air supply—can cause low oxygen levels. For freshwater fish, start with the rule of thumb of \"one gallon per one inch of adult fish,\" but keep in mind that this benchmark doesn\'t take into consideration the fact that some fish are larger-bodied and some varieties are more taxing on the aquarium environment than others. Use this rule only as a guideline when calculating the appropriate aquarium size and then do additional research and speak with experts at your local pet store. (Also, be sure to calculate the <i>adult</i> sizes of the fish in your aquarium—not the one- or two-inch juvenile fish that you bring home.)</p>\r\n<p>Another cause of low oxygen in an aquarium can be a lack of surface area. Rather than considering only the volume of your aquarium, think about purchasing one with a larger surface area—that is, one with more air contact. Two aquariums might have the same volume, but if the shape of one allows it to have more surface area (shallower rather than taller), it will have higher oxygen levels, and that\'s always good.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Lack of aeration</h3>\r\n<p>Keep your fish\'s habitat water on the move. Mixing existing water with the surface water helps maintain good water quality and a good supply of dissolved oxygen throughout the fish tank. A set-up of properly maintained aquarium filters is critical for removing waste. In some situations, an even more powerful form of aeration—such as a power head—may be needed. Bubble-producing décor elements like an air stone or bubble wand can also add small amounts of oxygen, but are more for decorative purposes.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Improper water temperature</h3>\r\n<p>Water temperature can also play a role in oxygen concentration. Warm water holds less oxygen than cold water, so during summer months keep an eye on your habitat\'s temperature. Avoid letting it rise too high for long periods of time by regulating your water\'s temperature with a fish tank heater or chiller.</p>\r\n<h2>Fish that are supposed to breathe at the top of their tank</h2>\r\n<p>Finally, keep in mind that some varieties of fish—like bettas and gourami\'s—are actually <i>supposed</i> to breathe air from the surface. So if your aquarium is home to one or more of these, be sure that you don’t mistake normal behavior for an oxygen issue.</p><h3>Related Articles</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a hrefs=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/new-pet/eight-tips-to-keep-your-freshwater-fish-happy-and-healthy.html\">How to Take Care of Freshwater Aquatic Life: Tips for New Fish Parents</a></li>\r\n<li>Large Marine Fish</li>\r\n<li>Small Marine Fish</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"hidden_title_aem\" id=\"why-is-my-fish-breathing-at-the-surface\" style=\"display:none\">Why is My Fish Breathing at the Surface?</div>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 15:57:29', '2021-08-31 15:57:29'),
(103, 67, '<p>Fish make beautiful pets that absolutely keep us entertained, but when their swimming habits change or become erratic it can cause us to wonder: “Is that normal?” Fish swimming in circles, up and down, backward and other consistent swim patterns are among the behaviors you may observe of your aquatic life at some point, and understanding them will help you know when things are perfectly normal, and when there is cause for concern.</p>\r\n<h2>Signs and symptoms of your fish swimming erratically</h2>\r\n<p><strong>The behavior:</strong> Rubbing or banging against items in their tank<br><strong>What it could mean:</strong> If you’ve noticed that your fish seems to be rubbing or banging against things in their aquarium frequently, they could be displaying what’s known as “flashing,” or “itchy fish.” As the name implies, a fish that’s constantly banging up against things in their aquarium could actually be trying to scratch themselves. There are a number of reasons they could be displaying this behavior, but the most common is parasites. If your fish is flashing, check for tiny white specks on your fish, which is the classic symptom of a parasite known as Ich. Both freshwater and saltwater fish can get this parasite —which is similar to fleas in mammals—and they can be very irritating.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gill or skin flukes, a wormlike parasite, may also cause similar erratic swimming behavior but can be harder to spot. A fading in your fish\'s color or change in the appearance of their gills—such as excessive visible mucus—can be indications of skin or gill flukes.</p>\r\n<p>If you notice what you believe to be behavior that’s indicative of Ich or flukes, contact a veterinarian who specializes in aquatic life for advice on treatment, which often entails a combination of over-the-counter remedies and quarantine (for Ich) or natural remedies (for flukes).<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>The behavior:</strong> Your fish is swimming erratically.<br><strong>What it could mean:</strong> It’s not uncommon for fish to swim erratically—fast and seemingly in no particular configuration or for an apparent purpose. However, if you begin to notice a pattern, it could indicate poor water quality in your tank. Common water quality issues in home aquariums include incorrect pH levels (the appropriate level varies from species to species, but usually a pH level between 6.8-7.5 is ideal for freshwater and 8 - 8.4 for marine life), ammonia buildup, high amounts of nitrates or nitrites or temperature changes. The water quality in your tank can change quickly, so regular water tests are essential. If your fish is being medicated, it’s important to test your water more frequently, since some treatments can impact the aquarium’s bacteria colonies and cause a change.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>The behavior:</strong> Your fish is swimming upside down or on their side<br><strong>What it could mean:</strong> If your fish has started swimming upside down or on their side, this could be a sign that they are suffering from something called swim bladder disease. When this occurs, a fish is unable to regulate the air that’s going in and out of their swim bladder and may swim either upside down or on their side in an attempt to regulate it. Swim bladder disease is fairly common in goldfish, and although the name implies that it’s one particular health issue, this “disease” is actually just the symptom, which can be caused by a number of different things. If you think your fish is suffering from swim bladder disease, discuss treatments with your veterinarian or an aquatics care specialist, since over-the-counter treatments are generally effective in helping solve the problem.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>The behavior:</strong> You notice your fish continually swimming in circles<br><strong>What it could mean:</strong> Although some circular movement is normal, a fish—and particularly a goldfish—that is constantly swimming in circles—especially in a rapid, darting motion—could have ammonia poisoning. Ammonia poisoning can happen in an aquarium when ammonia and nitrite, which are poisonous to fish, builds up in the water. Immediate treatments for ammonia poisoning are to stop feeding your fish (so as not to add to additional ammonia buildup) and to perform small, frequent water changes, while ensuring that it’s being properly aerated with either an air pump or water pump. Test the water frequently for ammonia buildup—levels should be at or near 0 ppm for both nitrites and ammonia—and then you can begin to feed your fish again.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have questions about your fish’s behavior—or about the proper setup of your aquarium to allow for the maximum health and safety of your fish—stop into your local My Puppy My Pet and talk to an aquatics specialist who can walk you through everything you need to know to care for your aquatic life and aquarium.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Related Articles</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a hrefs=\"https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/health-wellness/why-is-my-fish-breathing-at-the-surface.html\">Why is My Fish Breathing at the Surface?</a></li>\r\n<li>How to Take Care of Freshwater Aquatic Life: Tips for New Fish Parents</li>\r\n<li>Aquatic Life Safety</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 15:59:35', '2021-08-31 15:59:35'),
(104, 68, '<p>It can be difficult to notice when our pets are in distress, especially because they can’t tell us exactly what’s wrong. For aquatic life, this can be even more challenging, as can knowing what to do once a problem has been recognized. The truth is, even small, subtle changes in fish behavior or appearance can indicate stress. It’s important to know how fish become stressed and how to react quickly when it happens.</p>\r\n<h2>Why fish get stressed</h2>\r\n<p>Anyone who has fish knows that they are complicated creatures. Like humans, they get stressed but in ways you might not have considered. Some of the most common fish stressors include:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Poor water quality or incorrect water temperature: </strong>Besides the actual water that you put into your aquarium, water quality is impacted by a number of other factors, including the filter system (and whether it’s working properly), the accessories and décor in the habitat (gravel, aquatic plants and other objects), the food you feed your fish and even your fish itself. Different species of fish also require different water temperatures throughout the day. Without clean, properly maintained water, fish can easily become stressed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Moving to a new aquarium:</strong> Fish are extremely susceptible to stress due to changes in their environment. This is why cleanings—and especially making the move to an entirely new aquarium—should be done carefully and properly. Speak with a My Puppy My Pet aquatics specialist before you move your fish to a new aquarium to ensure you’re following the best procedure to avoid as much stress as possible for your fish.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Overcrowding:</strong> Not all fish are compatible and, even when they are, each one requires a certain amount of space in order to happily live and grow. Adding fish to an aquarium also increases the waste output, which may necessitate updates to filtration and additional cleaning procedures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lack of aquarium décor:</strong> While overcrowding an aquarium isn’t a good idea, neither is leaving it completely empty. The type of substrate you use is important (gravel and stone, for example, help provide a surface for good bacteria to colonize, which helps keep nitrogen levels in check), while real plants help stabilize nitrogen and CO2 levels. Adding décor for your fish to hide in and swim around is not only fun for them but often helps reduce stress in the aquarium, as long as you remember to clean it regularly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Improper diet:</strong> Your fish require a species-specific diet. The proper diet will help your fish live a long and healthy life, while an incorrect one may leave your pet lacking needed nutrients. Food remnants can also affect water quality and cause an aquarium to become dirty when excess food is not removed after feeding and buildup occurs between cleanings; making an effort not to overfeed your tank can help prevent these problems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Illness or injury:</strong> A fish who is suffering in some other way—like from an illness or injury—will likely have some additional stress side effects as well.</p>\r\n<h2>How to calm down stressed fish</h2>\r\n<p>If you notice that your fish is breathing heavily or gasping for air, or if you pick up on any behavioral (reduced activity, excessive hiding, sporadic movements or decreased appetite), physical (nicks or tears) or color changes (lighter to darker, darker to lighter, discoloration or spots), they could be suffering from stress.</p>\r\n<p>Before you can determine how to best help them, you’ll need to try to troubleshoot the cause. Run through the items above to determine if any of those factors have recently changed.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the changes that may have recently taken place, you can try:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Using a water quality test kit to ensure your habitat is at optimal pH, nitrate and ammonia levels for your fish’s species. You can also bring a sample of water into your local My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;where someone can test it for you.</li>\r\n<li>Checking that the filtration system is operating properly.</li>\r\n<li>Examining your fish’s skin and fins for fading colors (which could indicate skin or gill flukes) or small white specks (which could indicate Ich).</li>\r\n<li>Trying a stress coat product, which can help remove chlorine, neutralize chloramines and detoxify heavy metals to set up optimal water conditions. It can also help heal skin wounds and torn fins.</li>\r\n<li>Reducing overcrowding by moving additional fish to a new tank, or getting a larger aquarium.</li>\r\n<li>Provide additional oxygen to your tank by ensuring there is enough surface area of the water exposure to air, by using a waterfall, air pump or adding live plants.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you think your fish may be stressed, speak to an aquatics specialist who may be able to help diagnose the issue and help you find a solution.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 16:01:53', '2021-08-31 16:01:53'),
(105, 69, '<p>You do not need to be a chemist to set up an aquarium, but there are a few items that you will want to familiarize yourself with, a critical one being ammonia (NH3).

Overstocking or adding too many fish at once to a new aquarium that has not gone through the nitrogen cycle can increase ammonia levels that the tank is unable or ready to accommodate. &nbsp;Ammonia also enters the aquarium through the decomposition of uneaten food, fish waste and plant matter. Overfeeding can lead to large buildups of ammonia if left to accumulate. Water treatment facilities may utilize chloramine, a chemical that bonds chlorine to ammonia, as a disinfectant to make water safe to drink. Therefore, if untreated, tap water can contribute to ammonia entering the aquarium. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After setting up an aquarium your tank will go through a biological filtration process called the nitrogen cycle. This process is where beneficial bacteria establish themselves by feeding off waste and byproducts within the aquarium, converting it into less harmful byproducts. If a rapid change in water chemistry happens, like an aquarium filter failure or addition of medications, bacteria colonies can be disrupted or destroyed causing harmful ammonia to become elevated, often referred to as ammonia poisoning.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"textarea aem-GridColumn aem-GridColumn--default--12\">\r\n<h2>The Dangers of Elevated Ammonia</h2>\r\n<div class=\"hidden_title_aem\" id=\"ammonia-in-your-fish-tank\" style=\"display:none\">Ammonia in Your Fish Tank</div></div>\r\n<div class=\"petco-richtext parbase aem-GridColumn aem-GridColumn--default--12\">\r\n<p>Elevated ammonia is so dangerous because it has a direct impact to your finny friends’ blood and gills.&nbsp; Fish will try to combat ammonia burn by producing additional mucus. This extra buildup of mucus can cover the gills, reducing their ability to absorb oxygen. Ammonia also has a direct effect of concentration of hemoglobin in fish. Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen from the gills to their body tissue.</p>\r\n<p>Because ammonia can build quickly or over the course of a couple days, ammonia poisoning may not be noticed immediately. The gills of fish are their most sensitive area and fish breathing heavily, or gasping, at the top or bottom of the aquarium is a good indicator there may be an issue with elevated ammonia levels. A bright red or purplish coloration may also occur. As the effects of ammonia buildup continues, your fish will become lethargic, settle to the bottom of the aquarium, and refuse to eat. As a fish’s natural immune response is to produce mucus, you may notice discoloration and a grey like appearance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"textarea aem-GridColumn aem-GridColumn--default--12\">\r\n<h2>Removing Ammonia from your Aquarium</h2>\r\n<div class=\"hidden_title_aem\" id=\"ammonia-in-your-fish-tank\" style=\"display:none\">Ammonia in Your Fish Tank</div></div>\r\n<div class=\"petco-richtext parbase aem-GridColumn aem-GridColumn--default--12\">\r\n<p>If your aquarium is suffering from ammonia poisoning, you should complete a 50% water change. Do not forget to utilize a dechlorinator if using tap water and ensure the temperature is the same or within one degree of your aquarium water. &nbsp;This will provide your aquatic life some relief, but you may need to complete small daily water changes, keeping the ammonia at a safe level until the biological filtration is established. Stop feeding- at this point, if your fish are not eating, any food added to the tank is just contributing to the buildup of ammonia. Additionally, there are liquid ammonia neutralizing products that will assist with detoxifying ammonia. In freshwater, zeolite crystals can also be utilized to absorb ammonia. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”. Prevention is one of the best ways to avoid your aquatic life and tank succumbing to ammonia poisoning. Routinely testing your aquarium water, at least twice a month, will help detect potential concerns early. Control feedings, ensuring you are feeding the fish and not the aquarium. Refrain from adding too many fish to your aquarium at one time, this is especially critical for newly started aquariums since bacteria needs time to grow and take on the additional bioload.&nbsp;</p></div>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 16:03:47', '2021-08-31 16:03:47'),
(106, 70, '<p>It is not uncommon to occasionally observe oil, bubbles or foam forming in your aquarium. Before reacting, you need to determine if it is natural or dangerous. We going to review some common causes and when you should be concerned.</p>\r\n<h2>Protein</h2>\r\n<p>There are foams and oils that form in an aquarium which are caused by proteins. Protein foam or oily biofilms are created when waste proteins, fish waste, decaying debris, deceased aquatic life, or natural oils from food attach to small air bubbles. Saltwater aquarists can use a protein skimmer to extract proteins and oils from the water column. Unfortunately, protein skimmers do not work as effectively in freshwater due to the inability of freshwater to create the small air bubbles needed. These foams or oils are not initially deadly, but they are a sign that your aquarium needs to be cleaned and a water change is in order to help reduce this buildup. Increased surface agitation will also assist with breaking up these oils and increase gas exchange.</p>\r\n<h2>Cleaning Products</h2>\r\n<p>Concerning bubbles or films could be caused by something that has a high potential to cause harm to your aquatic life. If the bubbles or the film on the water’s surface have a rainbow tint, they could be caused by cleaning products. These products can make their way into the aquarium through items that were used for cleaning and now used for aquarium maintenance. Aerosol based cleaning products can also enter the aquarium if used near an open top tank. If these rainbow-colored films or bubbles are discovered, aquatic life should be removed, the aquarium drained and all décor, heater and filtration rinsed vigorously to remove all contaminants. Any filter media should be discarded and replaced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Natural Causes of Bubbles in Your Aquarium</h2>\r\n<p>Foam and bubbles can also be created through agitation. One of the most common forms of bubble and foam production comes when setting up a new aquarium or performing your routine tank cleaning. When filling a new aquarium, a lot of agitation is created causing bubbles or a slight foam to form at the water’s surface. Filtration and aeration components can also create agitation at the water’s surface causing bubbles to form, but nothing to be alarmed about as these are completely natural.</p>\r\n<p>You may notice bubbles forming on the aquarium glass, heater, and décor after completing a water change and asked yourself why? These bubbles formations have to do with water temperature. The incoming water, especially in the winter, is much colder than your tropical aquarium. Cold water can hold more oxygen than warmer water, so when this cold water enters the aquarium and mixes with the warm water, oxygen is released forming those little bubbles you are seeing. These are another form of bubbles in the aquarium you do not need to be concerned about.</p>\r\n<h3>Pearling</h3>\r\n<p>Does your aquarium have live plants? &nbsp;You may notice little bubbles forming on your plants, often referred to as pearling. Pearling, which is desired by plant hobbyists, is a part of the photosynthesis process of absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing carbon dioxide, indicating that your plants are thriving. Just a reminder, algae is a plant that utilizes photosynthesis so it will create these little bubbles as well.</p>\r\n<h3>Fish Medications</h3>\r\n<p>Do you have any aquatic life feeling a little under the weather? Adding medications to your aquarium can cause a slight water thickening. Due to this viscosity change, those bubbles that would rise and pop quickly will take a little longer to pop.</p>\r\n<h3>Bubblenest Foam</h3>\r\n<p>Bubble nesting fish can also be the cause of bubbles in your aquarium. Male Labyrinth fish species, like Gourami’s, Paradise fish, and Bettas build these bubble nests for their eggs to develop in.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 16:05:29', '2021-08-31 16:05:29'),
(107, 71, '<p>Keeping a pet iguana healthy and happy requires specialized care that is quite different from more conventional mammalian pets like dogs and cats. From heat lamps and terrariums to vegetarian diets and special humidity levels, it takes knowledge and planning to keep a reptile healthy—and iguanas—due to their large size—present special care requirements. An annual checkup with an exotic animal veterinarian will ensure that you are staying on top of any health concerns.</p>\r\n<p>Between veterinarian visits, here\'s what you should look for in a healthy iguana:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Clear eyes.</strong> Your iguana\'s eyes should be clear, with no tears, discharge or dry, crusty residue. Your iguana should be observant and attentive to what\'s going on in his environment. Iguanas have a third eye on top of their head that is called a parietal eye, and it looks like an oval-shaped pearl with an opaque covering. It is an actual organ, and is used to detect predators that may lurk above your iguana. This eye should also be clear and free of discharge.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A healthy nose.</strong> Iguanas sneeze regularly to rid their bodies of excess salt, and after your iguana sneezes, you\'ll certainly notice small salt deposits on his nose. These nasal salt deposits are a normal part of your iguana\'s life and are not a cause for concern. An excessively runny nose or discharge, however, is a sign of trouble and should be investigated.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Healthy skin.</strong> Your iguana\'s skin should be free of parasites, lesions, abrasions and sore spots. A healthy iguana will shed his skin anywhere from several times a year to once a year, depending on his size and age. You may need to help remove some of the dead skin from your iguana when he is shedding, but only if it can be done with little or no effort. Soaking, bathing and misting can also aid in the shedding process. Ask your veterinarian for tips on helping your iguana shed his skin.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A pink mouth.</strong> Besides being reasonably clean, the inside of your iguana\'s mouth should be a healthy pink color and should be free of discharge or any sign of infection. Stomatitis (“mouth rot”) is somewhat common in iguanas, and may go unnoticed without routine checks.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Strong bones.</strong> Pet iguanas are prone to Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD), which can be caused by lack of calcium in their diet, lack of UVB lighting or improper habitat temperatures. One of the first symptoms are thin bones that are easily broken from normal activities like climbing or jumping. You may notice swollen or bowed “Popeye” legs that feel lumpy or bumpy to the touch. Spinal cord injuries can also result from MBD, and can lead to paralysis if untreated. A spongy jawbone can also indicate MBD, and could cause a loss of appetite due to pain or difficulty eating. You can easily prevent MBD by taking proper care of your iguana.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A generally happy pet.</strong> Your iguana\'s normal behavior should be active and perky. He should be aware of his surroundings and he should be alert. He should have a steady gate when he walks, and he should be able to move around easily using both arms and legs, as well as his tail, without limping or favoring his limbs. Lethargy and disinterest can be signs of an ill reptile or a parasite problem so if you notice a change in your pet\'s normal physical activities or eating habits, consult with your veterinarian.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A good appetite.</strong> A serious drop in appetite—or avoidance of food altogether—can be an indication of illness. If your iguana gets too cold he will avoid eating until he\'s warmer; this is because reptiles need heat in order to digest their food. Monitor your iguana\'s droppings too, as any significant or prolonged change in habit or abnormal-looking feces could be an indicator that something is wrong.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Appropriate Habitat Size:</h2>\r\n<p>Make sure your iguana\'s habitat is the proper size for his size. Your iguana should be able to move around freely and turn around easily in his habitat. There should also be enough space for a hiding area and branches for a basking area.</p>\r\n<p>You may sometimes notice your iguana repeatedly rubbing his face or nose against his habitat, occasionally to the point of causing skin damage. While nose rubbing can be a sign of various frustrations—such as stress or breeding season—it\'s very often seen when the iguana\'s habitat is just too small. Iguanas require a surprisingly large habitat in order to thrive, and if this need isn\'t met, your pet can respond by nose rubbing. If other health or stress issues aren\'t present, consider providing a larger habitat for your iguana.</p>\r\n<p>Despite your affection for your pet, and despite the fact they live in your home with you, iguanas are nonetheless wild animals, and do not always show obvious outward signs of illness (doing so in a natural environment can put them at risk to predators). It\'s up to you to be on the offense as a pet parent. Be attuned to your iguana\'s normal routine, appearance and behaviors so you can detect a problem before it becomes serious. Luckily for you, this simply involves spending time with your pet, which is something you likely wish to do more often anyway.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 16:09:02', '2021-08-31 16:09:02'),

If you\'re one of those happy homes, you\'re probably well-attuned to your bird\'s personality and habits, and you likely recognize the basic signs of a healthy bird. Not sure? Here\'s what to look for in a healthy bird:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bright eyes.</strong> A healthy bird\'s eyes are free of discharge and appear bright and alert without redness or swelling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clear nostrils.</strong> Similarly, a healthy bird\'s nostrils should be free of discharge and your bird\'s beak should open and close easily and meet properly.</li>\r\n<li><strong>An alert expression.</strong> A healthy bird pays attention to his surroundings and is active and interested in what\'s going on around him. Watch for any signs of diminished interest or lethargy. Your bird should exhibit natural enthusiasm and his usual vocalizations. If your bird is sitting on the floor of his habitat, this could be a red flag.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clear skin.</strong> While it\'s true that birds are covered with voluminous feathers, skin is actually quite vital to their overall health. Healthy skin is clear and free of inflammation, redness or swelling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Beautiful feathers.</strong> A bird\'s feathers are his crowning glory, and a healthy bird\'s feathers are shiny, glossy and smooth. Damaged feathers or bald areas of missing feathers can be indicative of a problem. Plucking could indicate that your bird is bored, but it can also be a sign of illness.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Peaceful respiration.</strong> Your bird\'s breathing should be smooth, calm and silent. The bobbing of your bird\'s tail feathers as he breathes could indicate respiratory disease.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Good eating and drinking habits.</strong> Your bird should be interested in his food and water and maintain a regular schedule of eating and drinking. Deviation from this routine could indicate illness, although a sick bird may actually spend an increased amount of time at his food dish—but he may not be eating.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A healthy weight.</strong> An adult bird\'s weight should remain generally stable. Inexplicable weight gain or loss should be evaluated by a veterinarian. An annual examination can help to detect even the slightest changes in your bird\'s weight.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Good physical condition.</strong> A healthy bird exhibits normal physical characteristics (including his beak, feet and wings) and has a bright and chipper appearance.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Healthy bird droppings.</strong> Changes in your bird\'s droppings (including color, consistency and frequency) could indicate a possible problem. Regularly observe your bird\'s droppings to evaluate their appearance and to ensure a consistent schedule. Diarrhea could be a symptom of simple dietary changes or illness.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A clean, dry vent.</strong> The cloaca or vent is the opening to a bird\'s digestive, reproductive and urinary tracts and stores urates, feces, urine and eggs (in females). Fecal matter should not be present and the vent area should be free of discharge or swelling.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>An annual veterinary exam for your bird with a board-certified avian veterinarian is essential to your bird\'s overall health. You\'ll rest easier knowing that you have a knowledgeable veterinarian available to care for your bird and to help ensure that your bird enjoys a long, healthy, happy life.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-08-31 16:13:32', '2021-08-31 16:13:32'),

Take the time now to find a board-certified avian veterinarian near you and make an appointment so you can get to know each other and your bird can have an initial wellness exam.</p>\r\n<p>This is also the time to discuss a first-aid plan specific to your bird. Your veterinarian will be able to recommend bird supplies to keep on hand and advise if/when to use topical treatments, as some can be harmful.</p>\r\n<p>For minor injuries, you may be able to successfully perform first aid at home, though you\'ll still need to consult your veterinarian any time your bird is sick or injured.

Along with any recommendations from your avian veterinarian, your basic supplies should include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>A towel </li>\r\n<li>Sterile gauze pads and bandages </li>\r\n<li>Elastic bandage tape </li>\r\n<li>Cotton balls </li>\r\n<li>Styptic powder </li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen peroxide </li>\r\n<li>Iodine&nbsp; </li>\r\n<li>Antimicrobial pet wound spray </li>\r\n<li>Scissors </li>\r\n<li>Nail clippers </li>\r\n<li>A hemostat </li>\r\n<li>Heating pad </li>\r\n<li>Bird carrier </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Note that some items have a limited shelf life (for example, hydrogen peroxide can expire 30–45 days after being opened), so check your first-aid kit regularly and discard expired products.</p>', 'storage/1630405007.jpg', NULL, '2021-08-31 16:16:47', '2021-08-31 16:16:47'),
(111, 74, '<h2>Learn basic bird first-aid skills</h2>\r\n<p>From daily mishaps to grooming accidents, knowing the basic steps to treat or stabilize your bird before you call your vet can help ease the pain and stress on your pet.</p>\r\n<h3>How to treat minor cuts or wounds</h3>\r\n<p>The first thing to know if your bird experiences a minor bleeding injury such as a cut, beak chip or broken toenail is to stay calm to avoid upsetting your pet further. Anxiety causes the heart rate to rise, which can cause additional bleeding. To treat a small bleeding wound:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Gently apply pressure to the small cut with a clean piece of gauze or a gauze pad</li>\r\n<li>Do not hold your bird by the chest or compress their chest as this can cause suffocation</li>\r\n<li>Apply pressure until the bleeding subsides. This can take up to 10 minutes.</li>\r\n<li>Allow your bird time to calm down and destress before taking any other action. Ensure they begin eating normally and seem to be getting back to their normal personality before moving forward. If your bird does not begin eating or still seems stressed, contact your veterinarian.</li>\r\n<li>While your bird will likely begin preening around the area of the wound themselves once they have calmed down. After the bleeding has stopped, you may help clean the surrounding area with water if needed. You will need to avoid the actual wound site as it may open back up with water and gentle pressure/rubbing. Remember your bird is likely still stressed after their accident, so only clean the area once they are calm and if they need assistance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For broken toenails or chipped beaks:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Apply styptic powder to the damaged spot \r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Cornstarch, baking soda or flour can be used if you don\'t have styptic powder, although it may be less effective </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Apply pressure to the area with a clean cloth or gauze pad until bleeding stops </li>\r\n<li>If the wound is large or does not stop bleeding, call your veterinarian as soon as possible</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>How to treat broken blood feathers</h3>\r\n<p>A broken blood feather can be an alarming sight. These young feathers are still growing, and the shafts have blood inside of them. A blood feather can sometimes break on its own or when your bird\'s wings are being clipped. If your bird experiences a broken blood feather:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Apply pressure with a sterile gauze pad to stop the bleeding </li>\r\n<li>When the bleeding stops, immediately contact your veterinarian to determine if the feather needs to be removed </li>\r\n<li>If a veterinary visit is required, carefully wrap your bird in a towel and put them in their bird carrier</li>\r\n<li>As removing a blood feather can be very painful and can result in further injuries if not removed properly, never attempt to remove a blood feather on your own unless you have been trained to do so. Always consult your veterinarian for their help. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>How to treat heat stress</h3>\r\n<p>Birds can become overheated on hot days. Signs of heat stress, which can lead to life-threatening heatstroke if you don’t take immediate steps to cool your bird down, include&nbsp; panting and holding their wings away from their body. To cool your bird down:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Move your bird to a cooler part of the house and mist them with cool water \r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Avoid putting your bird in front of an air conditioner or fan </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Make sure your bird has access to clean, fresh water and closely monitor their behavior </li>\r\n<li>Contact your veterinarian and explain the situation and your bird\'s demeanor&nbsp; </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Remember that seasons and weather change and the location of your bird’s habitat may have to change along with them. Avoid hot, direct sunlight, drafty windows in winter, and air that blows directly on them to help mitigate stress and keep their environment comfortable.</p>\r\n<h3>How to care for a broken wing</h3>\r\n<p>A broken wing requires immediate veterinary attention. Use elastic bandaging tape to lightly wrap your pet—not too tight—and prevent wing movement during transport.</p>\r\n<h2>When to see a veterinarian</h2>\r\n<p>While some smaller cuts and wounds can be cared for at home, there are many medical situations that require immediate veterinary attention. In addition to those mentioned above, these include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Respiratory issues </li>\r\n<li>Scratch or bite wounds inflicted by&nbsp; other pets </li>\r\n<li>Egg binding </li>\r\n<li>Shock </li>\r\n<li>Eye infections </li>\r\n<li>Fractures </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that the list above is not exhaustive and that one of the first signs of illness in birds—and most pets—is a change in behavior. Regularly observe your bird\'s normal behavior from a distance. If you see a change, contact your veterinarian.

(112, 75, '<p>Feathers are often the first thing we notice about birds, but there’s far more to these creatures than beauty and grandeur. The state of their feathers can tell you a lot about the health and well-being of your bird. Although some feathers do fall out in the natural course of molting, a bird who continually pulls them out may be sending you a signal that something is wrong.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is your bird plucking feathers?</h2>\r\n<p>Feather picking—or feather plucking— s a self-destructive behavior that’s unique to birds. A bird who plucks their own feathers without intervention can cause themselves physical harm, including infections from open sores. While some birds, including cockatiels, cockatoos, African Grey Parrots, macaws and conures, seem more prone to feather picking than others, all birds are at risk of adopting this behavior. A variety of factors can play a role, so awareness is the key to identifying them before they become problematic.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Underlying health reasons.</strong> A bird who’s not feeling well may begin plucking their feathers as a form of self-care or self-soothing or because they’re being irritated by an underlying condition. If you notice this behavior in your pet, visit your veterinarian to rule out things like infections (bacterial, viral and parasitic), allergies (pollen, mold and specific foods, for example), hypothyroidism and anxiety.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Environmental factors.</strong> Heat, humidity, noise and stress can cause feather plucking, as can too much or too little access to natural sunlight.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Lifestyle factors.</strong> Some birds turn to feather plucking because of lifestyle conditions like boredom, lack of exercise or activity, sexual frustration, isolation or a lack of playtime with their pet parent.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Nutrition.</strong> Malnutrition can also lead to feather plucking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Bird preening vs. feather plucking</h3>\r\n<p>It’s important to recognize the difference between preening and plucking. Preening is a normal, healthy maintenance behavior performed to remove dirt, spread oil and adjust feather position to keep feathers healthy. Plucking is a destructive behavior in which a bird actively pulls out their feathers and that, over time, can damage the feather follicles and stop the growth of healthy new feathers.</p>\r\n<h2>How to stop your bird from plucking their feathers</h2>\r\n<p>If you notice unhealthy feather-picking behavior, it’s essential to immediately schedule an appointment with a board-certified avian veterinarian. They can help you evaluate whether your bird’s habit is due to an underlying medical or behavioral concern. A bird behavior specialist or board-certified veterinary behaviorist may also be needed to help diagnose the problem.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, try to avoid overreacting when you witness feather picking in progress. Making a big deal of the event can perpetuate the problem or cause your bird to see your response as positive attention. It is also possible that your pet takes on your stress which may cause the behavior to continue. In order to mitigate the issue before your vet visit or, more importantly, stop it before it starts, focus on:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Sticking to a routine:</strong> Routines are important for your bird and should be followed as closely as possible. Ensure your bird is getting the proper amount of sleep, has plenty of nutrients and vitamins in their diet and receives a lot of love and interaction from you.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Minimizing stress:</strong> If you believe stress is the cause of your bird’s feather plucking, try imagining yourself in their position. A full view of stressful things going on outside a window—animal or human activity, for example, may make your bird feel confined in their habitat and frightened. In this case, simply moving them to another location might help. Birds are also perceptive to the moods of their human family. If you are feeling anxious or stressed, it’s likely they are, too.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Relieving boredom:</strong> Birds need a lot of mental stimulation to remain fit and burn energy. Try rotating your bird’s selection of toys, and choose from a variety of wood blocks, ladders, ropes, barbells and hanging toys that are specific to your bird’s size and species. Remember that birds are very social animals. Simple games like playing peekaboo with you can be fun and encourage trust.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Providing a healthy diet:</strong> Birds should receive a diet that’s full of all the nutrients and vitamins they need to remain healthy based on their species, but <em>how</em> you feed them is important, too. Foraging behavior, for example, should be incorporated into their feeding routine.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Examining their environment:</strong> Birds are very sensitive, and cigarette smoke, air fresheners and pungent cleaning supplies can all irritate them. If you think one of these factors could be upsetting your bird, try moving their habitat to a different location or eliminating possible environmental irritants one by one to see if the feather plucking stops. Whenever possible, keep your bird in an area with plenty of familiar and comforting activity to observe. When you leave home, consider turning on music or a TV for extra comfort. Birds are also very sensitive to temperature changes, so a drastic change in either of these—and in the amount of natural sunlight they receive—can make a big difference.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Do bird’s feathers grow back?</h3>\r\n<p>In most cases, a bird who loses their feathers will get them back in about 12 months or during their next molt. They may not grow back, however, if the underlying skin structure becomes damaged.</p>\r\n<p>While it’s often easy to troubleshoot the cause of feather-plucking behavior, it’s always a good idea to seek the advice of a trained veterinarian who is knowledgeable about avian health and stressors.

To figure out which size dog bed is best for your four-legged pal, measure them from nose to tail while they’re sleeping and add a few inches.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Your dog’s sleeping habits</strong>: The shape of the bed will depend on your pup’s sleeping habits. Maybe your dog enjoys curling up and snuggling the night away. Or perhaps you have a canine who’d rather stretch out for a good night’s rest. For either sleeping type, we offer bed shapes that cater to their unique sleeping needs. Oval and round designs are the best dog beds for small dogs that like to nap curled up. The high sides provide support and security for pups who like to lean against something familiar.

(117, 77, '<p>When deciding how to potty train a puppy, or a newly adopted dog, you have two options— train them to relieve themselves outdoors, or inside your home on a pee pad and then transition them to the outdoors. We’ll take you through both options and give you tips to incorporate crate potty training into your plan.</p>\r\n<h2>How to Train a Puppy to Pee Outside</h2>\r\n<p>Your puppy can’t tell you they have to relieve themselves, <em>or can they</em>? They <strong><em>can</em></strong> if you teach them a “potty cue.” Potty cues begin by showing your pet how to signal they want to go outdoors. From there, your puppy will associate the feeling of peeing with being outside of your home. Here’s how to get started:</p>\r\n<h3>Step 1: Teach your puppy the potty cue</h3>\r\n<p>Have your puppy sit by the back door. When your pet barks, open the back door and let them out. Rather not teach your pup to bark? Try a bell. When your pet rings the bell, open the door and take them outside. Remember, the potty cue is just for going potty, don’t let your puppy play too much outside after doing their business - otherwise, they will associate the cue with getting to play outside, not just going potty.</p>\r\n<h4>What to do if you need to change the potty cue</h4>\r\n<p>So you taught your puppy to bark when they need to go to the bathroom, but now they bark nonstop. You can try teaching them a new cue like sitting at the door. You could even place a rug by the door, and train your puppy to know that when they sit on the rug, you open the door.

(118, 77, '<h3>Step 2: Determine a set potty area</h3>\r\n<p>Put your puppy on a leash and walk them out to the part of the yard you want your dog to relieve themselves at. Don’t continue walking. Instead, wait for your pet to relieve themselves. When your puppy does, reward them with treats and verbal praise. This will make peeing outside a positive experience. If they don’t go, take your puppy back in the house and repeat. They will catch on fast.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 3: Use a crate when you’re not home</h3>\r\n<p>When you aren’t home with your pet, confine them to an area, such as a crate. This helps limit accidents in your bedroom, living room, or any other areas when you aren’t there to hear or see the cue.</p>\r\n<h2>The Indoors-to-Outdoors Method</h2>\r\n<p>If you don’t have a yard, or your puppy is in the process of completing their shots, it may be best to begin potty training indoors and then transition your pet to the outdoors.

(120, 77, '<h3>Crate potty training</h3>\r\n<p>Before you begin crate potty training, you need the right size containment. Keep in mind your pet only needs enough space to stand up, turn around, and lie down. Any more room will encourage them to relieve themselves in one corner and sleep in another. Some crates come with dividers so you can adjust the size as they grow.</p>\r\n<p>To get your puppy used to their crate, toss a treat in and allow them to go inside and come back out. Praise your puppy each time they enter. Work your way up to your pet spending 10 minutes in their crate and then longer once they’re comfortable. When your puppy associates their crate as their living space, crate potty training begins.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of soiling the area where they sleep and eat, they’ll let you know they need to go. Like other potty training methods, developing a routine is key. Within fifteen minutes of eating, drinking or playing, your puppy should have the opportunity to relieve themselves. For more tips on crate potty training, check out our crate training guide.</p>\r\n<h2>How Long Does it Take to Potty Train a Puppy?</h2>\r\n<p>There is no defined timeframe when it comes to how to potty train a puppy. There are many factors that come into play, with consistency being the most important. Be sure to reward your puppy when they follow their training plan.</p>\r\n<h3>Dealing with accidents</h3>\r\n<p>Accidents will happen no matter how much you try to prevent them. It’s a matter of determining the cause and reinforcing positive behavior. Recognizing when your pet is stressed or what continually triggers accidents will help you come up with corrective measures. For cleaning up messes, be sure to give the soiled area a good cleaning. Pet-safe stain removers and odor removers are good cleaning products to have on hand.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that even a house trained puppy will have accidents when out and about. To limit this behavior, keep your puppy’s schedule as consistent as possible. If you’re going on a trip or visiting friends, take your puppy on a long walk with lots of opportunities to empty their bladder beforehand. Bringing toys is another useful technique, as they can help keep your pet focused on an activity. </p>\r\n<p>Potty training a puppy takes time and commitment, so don’t lose your patience. When you feel your pet is straying off course, return to the basics. Whichever method you choose, stick to it and develop a routine. With positive reinforcement, your pet will begin to recognize when they are showing good behavior.

(121, 78, '<p>Everyone likes to have their own comfy spot—a personal place to relax and enjoy themselves, complete with all their favorite things. Your dog is no exception, but what are the best types of hangouts for dogs? What amenities should a dog’s hangout include? Let’s take a look.</p>\r\n<h2>Crates</h2>\r\n<p>A crate—usually made of plastic or wire—is arguably the most important piece of dog housing you’ll buy. Most dogs feel the safest and most secure when they have their own private “den” to retreat to when the world becomes busy or noisy. Crates are also useful for training purposes. For added comfort, place a bed, mat or pad on the floor of your dog’s crate.</p>\r\n<p>Wire crates can be portable if they fold up, so they can be a convenient choice, especially for large dogs. Wire crates also tend to provide better ventilation for your dog since they’re more open to the air than plastic crates. For more of a den feel, drape a blanket over the wire crate.</p>\r\n<p>Plastic crates provide a confined feel that helps a timid dog feel safe and less vulnerable—more like a real “den.” The most important aspect of choosing a dog crate is to select the correct size—large enough to be comfortable, small enough for your dog to feel safe.</p>\r\n<p>Don’t forget your dog’s home away from home. For traveling, whether it’s by plane or vehicle, you’ll want a dedicated dog travel crate that is appropriately sized for your dog. When traveling in a vehicle, securing your dog in a crate that is fastened in place is the safest way. When selecting a carrier for airline travel, you’ll need to purchase one that is specifically approved for airline use. Be sure to introduce your pet to the travel crate well before your planned departure date so there are no surprises on trip day.</p>\r\n<h2>Outdoor enclosures</h2>\r\n<p>If you have a lot of property that isn’t enclosed, outdoor kennels, runs and exercise pens are an option for allowing your dog to go outside to play unattended. They provide safe, fenced areas for your dog to play, relax, snooze in the shade, have fun in the sun and basically have an all-around good doggie time. Outdoor enclosures can be as elaborate or as simple as your budget allows. Large runs can be custom-built or small ones can be purchased complete—ready to set up and enjoy. They are typically weatherproof and easy to assemble. Choose a dry location for your outdoor enclosure, in an area that provides both access to and relief from direct sunlight. Make sure your dog always has access to fresh, clean water when he’s outside.</p>\r\n<p>There are also countless dog houses available in a variety of sizes and styles. A good dog house is well-ventilated, consists of high-quality construction and has an elevated floor. To choose the correct size, make sure that your dog can comfortably stand up, turn around and lie down in his dog house. It should be placed somewhere in your yard that will be cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Weatherproof mats are available for added comfort.</p>\r\n<p>There are even portable tents that are convenient for travel and provide a safe place for your pet to retreat to—whether at the beach, the park, a campground or anywhere on-the-go.</p>\r\n<h2>Doors</h2>\r\n<p>Once you have that perfect outdoor environment created for your dog, he’ll need the perfect way to access it. While you can always put your dog on a leash and walk him to his run yourself, many people (and dogs) enjoy the convenience of a dog door for this purpose. Dog doors are also convenient for allowing your dog to enter and exit your home when he has to go to the bathroom, as long as you have a safe, fenced-in area for your dog to access. Take care to install your dog door properly to prevent unwanted access from other animals, as well as to prevent drafts. Purchase a dog door that is the right size for your dog or puppy’s adult size, and follow the instructions to ensure that it’s installed at the correct height.</p>\r\n<h2>Beds, blankets, pillows and pads</h2>\r\n<p>Different dogs prefer different types of bedding for napping and a good night’s sleep. Deciding what your dog prefers will depend on his personal preference and his style of sleeping—does he like to curl up in a ball, nose-to-tail? He might like a padded, oval bed. Does he like to stretch out, limbs and body extended? A simple pillow-style dog bed may be just the ticket. You can also choose a bed, mat or pad to fit inside on the floor of your dog’s crate. For older or arthritic dogs, an orthopedic bed with memory foam can provide extra comfort. If your dog likes to nap on the couch, a cozy fleece pet blanket is a good choice. Bed warmers are an added bonus in colder climates, and cooling dog beds help keep your pet cool when temperatures are hot. Provide a variety for your dog, and be sure to wash his bedding regularly and replace old or worn-out beds.</p>\r\n<h2>Toys</h2>\r\n<p>You don’t want your play-loving dog to be bored when he’s hanging out in his favorite spots, so be sure to choose a selection of age- and size-appropriate toys for him to enjoy. Buying several different toys and rotating them regularly will help keep them interesting to your dog; dogs tend to become bored with the same toys after a while. Puzzle toys, interactive toys and treat-dispensing toys will keep your dog mentally stimulated and occupied. Select only safe toys for your dog and observe him as he plays with them. Regularly clean or disinfect dog toys and discard any old or worn-out ones.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 15:01:52', '2021-09-01 15:01:52'),
(122, 79, '<p>Almost nothing strikes more fear in the heart of a pet owner than coming to the realization that their pet is suffering from fleas or ticks. Dealing with a flea or tick infestation can be a long and drawn-out process, but the first stage involves identifying that your pet actually has fleas or ticks and then figuring out the best way to treat them. Here’s some advice to get you started.</p>\r\n<h2>How to tell if your cat or dog has fleas</h2>\r\n<p>Fleas can be hard to detect early in their life cycle, but there are some telltale signs to look for. Use a cat flea comb or a dog flea comb to search for the physical pest and be on the lookout for the following additional signs of an infestation:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Excessive itching, scratching or chewing</li>\r\n<li>Tiny, red, raised bumps or pimples</li>\r\n<li>Flea dirt— tiny black or dark red droppings that smear into reddish brown streaks when a damp white paper towel is wiped over an infested pet’s coat</li>\r\n<li>Hair loss</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How to tell if your cat or dog has ticks</h2>\r\n<p>Ticks are often visible to the human eye if you look carefully. Particularly focus on warm, dark, sheltered areas, like ears and armpits and between the toes. Other signs include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Excessive licking, chewing or scratching of a specific area or an unexplained scab</li>\r\n<li>Fever</li>\r\n<li>A small bump or lump</li>\r\n<li>Head shaking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Treating your pet for fleas or ticks</h2>\r\n<p>There are a number of things to keep in mind before you begin any sort of treatment. First, always use the appropriate product on the appropriate animal—don’t use a flea treatment meant for dogs on a cat—and follow all instructions. If your pet has specific health considerations—like if they are like if they are pregnant, have allergies or are taking medications—be sure to discuss your options with your veterinarian.</p>\r\n<p>Flea and tick treatment doses are often based on your pet’s age and weight, and you’ll always want to pay special attention to any adverse reactions. These can include everything from skin redness or swelling to vomiting, scratching and other unusual behaviors. Although it is possible to remove ticks yourself, it’s important to understand the proper way to remove a tick before doing so. With all of that in mind, some of the more common pest treatments include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Oral treatment and prevention: A few pest products start working within 15 minutes to an hour and are great options when a fast resolution is needed. Discuss the recommended options with your vet.</li>\r\n<li>Flea and tick shampoo: Flea shampoos are designed to kill fleas immediately as well as clean, deodorize and condition the coat, an ongoing prevention method should then be implemented&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Flea and tick spot treatment: Generally used on a monthly basis to control a population by killing adults and preventing eggs from hatching. Spot treatments vary, so it’s best to discuss your options with your veterinarian.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Flea and tick spray: Topical treatments that can be used to kill fleas on contact</li>\r\n<li>Flea dip: A medicated dip that can be used after bathing to remove existing fleas.</li>\r\n<li>Environmental treatments for homes and yards: Sprays, bombs and powders can be effective at reducing the pest population to reduce the risk your pet brings pests back inside after they have been treated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>No matter which treatment option you choose to combat a pest infestation, it is important that you also work with your veterinarian to develop a year-round prevention strategy for your particular pet. This will not only help prevent a future infestation, but also help protect your pet from the diseases and complications that these pests cause and transmit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although dealing a flea and tick infestation can be frustrating, the most important thing is to remain calm and to ensure you follow all the appropriate steps to start helping your pet feel better in the immediate and remain that way.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 15:09:59', '2021-09-01 15:09:59'),

(124, 81, '<p>Cats are selective when it comes to many things—their litter box is no exception. With tons of factors to consider like the size, material, and different types, this can make finding the best litter box for your cat feel like a chore! To help, we put together a handy guide so you can find a litter box your feline will love, and more importantly, use.</p>\r\n<h2>The Basics: Size, Material, and Location</h2>\r\n<p>Comfort is key when getting your cat accustomed to their litter box. They need enough space to step inside, turn around, scratch, and squat without bumping into the sides. The best litter box for kittens or smaller cats will require lower sides, around 2-3 inches. A box that is 24 inches long or wide, with 4-inch walls, is a good option for full-grown cats.</p>\r\n<p>Most litter boxes are made of plastic since it doesn’t absorb unpleasant cat waste odors. There are also disposable boxes made from 100% recycled paper which neutralize ammonia gases and allow air to flow through. Wooden washrooms are available if you’re looking for something that blends with your decor.</p>\r\n<p>When picking a spot for your cat’s litter box, find a place where they have privacy. High traffic areas of your home will make your cat less inclined to use their box. Any time you replace your cat’s litter box with a new one, place it in the same location. Cats are creatures of habit and moving their box could confuse or upset them. If you must find a new spot, make sure they have easy access.</p>\r\n<h2>Different Types of Litter Boxes</h2>\r\n<p>Now it’s time for the fun—finding the best litter box for your cat! Before jumping in, consider your cat’s habits. Knowing their litter behavior or any special conditions will help you determine what they need. A cat that hates anyone noticing when they relieve themselves will welcome the added privacy. Senior cats who suffer from arthritis or aching joints will need a litter box that is easy to step into. Here are a few of the most common litter box options:</p>\r\n<h3>Best litter box for multiple cats—open litter pans</h3>\r\n<p>Cats are territorial which is why some pet parents follow the one litter box per cat rule. But what if your home doesn’t have space for more than one box? Or, what if your cats can’t figure out when the box is available? This is where open litter pans save the day!</p>\r\n<p>Litter pans take up less space and are easy to clean. The open design allows cats to see each other so they can determine when it’s safe to handle their business. But before making your decision, know that odors may be more noticeable because of the open top. Curious dogs or children are other areas of concern since there’s no barrier to keep them out.</p>', 'storage/1630487868.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-01 15:17:48', '2021-09-01 15:17:48');

(128, 82, '<p>An aquarium with a variety of different aquatic life can be a beautiful addition to your home. Fish make wonderful, colorful pets and are relatively easy to care for as long as their pet parents are knowledgeable and diligent. With a little preparation, the right supplies and regular maintenance, your fish can live happy, healthy lives.</p>\r\n<h2>What You’ll Need to Set Up an Aquarium</h2>\r\n<p>Creating your own aquarium oasis can seem like a daunting task. Just start with these basics and you will be well on your way to accomplishing your goal.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><b>The Right Tank:</b> Aquariums come in all shapes and sizes to fit any budget or skill level. A 29-gallon tank is a great place to start.</li>\r\n<li><b>A Solid Stand:</b> A 29-gallon tank is heavier than it sounds, weighing over 250 pounds with water and even more after you’ve added decor and substrate. Your aquarium needs a sturdy stand, capable of handling the weight and best sitting at eye level for you and your family to admire.</li>\r\n<li><b>A Secure Cover and Cozy Light:</b> Fish love to explore and some have the ability to jump out of the water. A cover for your tank will keep them safe and secure. There are a variety of lighting options that are specifically designed to illuminate your tank and help aquatic plants thrive. Be sure to turn the light off at night so your fish can rest when you head to bed.</li>\r\n<li><b>A Filter to Keep Your Aquarium Clean:</b> Filters sift debris and give good bacteria a home to break down waste. Be sure to clean your filter regularly with lukewarm water and a soft brush, never with soap or chemicals, to unclog any lingering debris. With so many different types of filters available in the market, it might make your head spin trying to find the right one. Consult a Petco aquatic specialist to find the right one for your aquarium.</li>\r\n<li><b>A (relatively) Quiet Air Pump:</b> Air pumps drive air-stones and air toys, circulating the water in your aquarium to provide much-needed oxygen for your fish. To prevent water from siphoning back when the pump is off, install a check valve in-line with your pump’s tubing and place the pump near the top of your aquarium, above the water level. Before you buy, check the air pump for noise and make sure it is the right size for your tank.</li>\r\n<li><b>A Heater to Keep your Fish Comfy:</b> Fish like to be cozy just like us. A consistent water temperature close to that of the natural habitat of your fish will help reduce stress within your aquarium. If you have any questions regarding the &nbsp;ideal water temperature for your aquatic life, consult a Petco aquatic specialist.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Filling Your New Aquarium</h2>\r\n<p>After purchasing your new aquarium, make sure to set it up, add water, substrate and plants and allow it to settle for at least 24 - 48 hours before adding fish.</p>\r\n<p>Once you’ve got your aquarium set up, you’ll be ready to choose which fish will populate your tank. Choosing the right type of water and fish will be the key to a harmonious aquarium. Remember, your tank is still cycling, while adding beneficial bacteria can help this process, it’s always wise to start off with a small amount of fish and monitor your water chemistry to ensure your tank can properly keep up with your new bio-load. Consult a My Puppy My Pet aquatic specialist to find out more about the nitrogen cycle and what’s best for starting up your new aquarium, regarding adding aquatic life!</p>\r\n<h3>Types of Water</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><b>Freshwater:</b> With less variables compared to a saltwater aquarium; this is a good place for new aquatic enthusiasts to get their feet wet! You don’t have to get a saltwater tank to have beautiful fish; with hundreds of different types of fish and colors, there is something for everyone!</li>\r\n<li><b>Saltwater:</b> Also known as marine or seawater, maintaining a saltwater tank tends to be more of a challenge as saltwater requires a lot more experience with water chemistry, patience and understanding. Before starting a saltwater tank, consult a My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;aquatic specialist with any questions you may have.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Varieties of Aquarium Life:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><b>Coldwater Fish</b>: Coldwater fish are generally thought to only be goldfish but there are plenty of other beautiful fish species, including some marine species, that appreciate a home in a cooler aquarium.</li>\r\n<li><b>Tropical fish: </b>Tropical fish, which include freshwater and saltwater species, are beautiful and come in many varieties, sizes and colors.</li>\r\n<li><b>Brackish fish</b>: Brackish water is a good way to gain an understanding of some of the extra detail that needs to be understood for a saltwater tank. There is a good amount of species that can live in freshwater and brackish water allowing the system to be a little more forgiving than a full saltwater aquarium would be. Consult your My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;aquatic specialist to learn more about brackish water fish and their needs.</li>\r\n<li><b>Goldfish</b>: A classic favorite, goldfish are a hardy bunch coming in many different shapes, sizes and colors. Be careful not to mix goldfish with tropical fish as the two varieties need very different environments.</li>\r\n<li><b>Aquatic plants</b>: Aquatic plants can add a natural appearance and a number of benefits to your aquarium. Aquarium plants need nutrients and depending on the species, between 8 to 10 hours of adequate lighting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Introducing Life to Your Aquarium</h2>\r\n<p>You’ve chosen the types of aquatic life you want to live in your aquarium and now it’s time to introduce them to their new home.

Fold the top edge of the bag down one inch to create an air pocket within the lip of the bag. This air pocket will allow the bag to float on the surface of the water. If possible, secure the bag to the side of your aquarium with an algae or lettuce clip.</li>\r\n<li>Test the specific gravity of your aquarium water as well as the specific gravity of the water in the bag to make sure they are close to matching</li>\r\n<li>Open the bag and slowly add aquarium water to the bag, using a quarter cup for small bags and half a cup for large bags. Close the bag again, then repeat every five minutes until the bag is filled. If there is more than a .004 difference in the specific gravity, double the amount of time between adding water to the bag.</li>\r\n<li>Once it is full, remove the bag from the aquarium and discard half of the water in the bag into a bucket. Be careful not to harm your aquatic life.</li>\r\n<li>Let the bag float again in the aquarium and repeat steps 6 and 7. This step allows further acclimation and will eliminate most of the original water in the bag.</li>\r\n<li>Once the bag is full, remove it from the aquarium and slowly pour out as much water as possible into a bucket without harming your aquatic life.</li>\r\n<li>Grasping the bottom corner, lower the bag into your aquarium.</li>\r\n<li>Lifting the bottom corner of the bag, let your new fish swim out of the bag. If you are introducing an invertebrate, submerse the bag and carefully remove the invertebrate. For corals, be careful to handle only by the base.</li>\r\n<li>Be sure not to pour any remaining water in the bag into the tank.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><b style=\"font-size: 0.9375em;\">Important things to remember</b><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Never rush the acclimation process. Following the steps patiently can even help revive aquatic life that appears listless or inactive.</li>\r\n<li>Always let your fish swim out of the bag on their own. Trying to handle the fish with your hands or pouring them into a net may remove the protective slime coating making your fish vulnerable to disease.</li>\r\n<li>Do not use an airstone in the bag when acclimating a new life to your tank. Airstones increase pH much too quickly and exposes aquatic life to lethal levels of ammonia.</li>\r\n<li>Keep your aquarium lights off for several hours after introducing new aquatic life to reduce stress.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Acclimating invertebrates to your aquarium:</h3>\r\n<p>Stable water quality, temperature, pH levels and specific gravity of 1.020-1.025 are crucial to avoid severe stress and trauma to invertebrates and marine plants. If you are unsure of the water quality or pH levels of your tank, My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;provides free water testing.</p>\r\n<h3>Introducing coral to your aquarium:</h3>\r\n<p>After you’ve acclimated a new coral to your tank, you may need to remove excess slime that some &nbsp;corals produce. Taking care not to touch the “flesh” part of a coral and using powder-free latex gloves, hold the coral by the rock or skeletal base and shake it gently in the shipping bag before placing in aquarium. It may take a few days for the coral to open after it has been introduced to your tank.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining a Flourishing Aquarium</h2>\r\n<p>Fish, like people, have very distinct personalities. As a pet parent, you’ll want to consider the different temperaments of your fish when introducing new species to your tank. Keep these tips in mind to make sure your aquarium is a happy, peaceful place.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>When planning the amount of fish you want in your aquarium, a good general rule to follow is the 1” of fish per gallon ratio for freshwater tanks (with the exception of goldfish which should be 1” of fish per 5 gallons and 1” of fish per 3 gallons of water for saltwater tanks and take into account your fish’s adult size to avoid overcrowding or your fish outgrowing their environment.</li>\r\n<li>Make sure that the species in your tank are compatible before introducing them to each other. Some fish just don’t get along.</li>\r\n<li>Depending on the species and size of the fish in your aquarium, you may want to separate aggressive carnivores from other fish that are not the same size and temperament. You don’t want a new addition to wind up a snack for an old friend.</li>\r\n<li>Different fish prefer specific areas in the aquarium. Some fish eat at the top while others prefer the mid-level of the tank and some choose to lay low at the bottom of the tank. Balance the levels to reduce competition for space.</li>\r\n<li>Decorating the landscape inside your tank is not only fun, it provides hiding places and shelters for your fish to explore.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Socializing the New Guy</h2>\r\n<p>An aquarium can be like a playground. Sometimes the new kid on the block can have a hard time fitting in. If your new fish is being harassed by one of the older ones, try these options:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Feed your fish before introducing a new fish to the aquarium to alleviate any aggressive behavior.</li>\r\n<li>Change or move decorations around to reduce territorial disputes.</li>\r\n<li>Floating plastic holding tanks can confine aggressive fish for several hours while the new arrival adjusts to the new surroundings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Adding Plant Life to Your Aquarium</h2>\r\n<p>Adding plants to your tank can really liven up your aquarium. Plants offer beautiful decoration and fun hiding places for your fish. However, just like other living things in your aquarium, plants need specific attention to thrive.</p>\r\n<p><b>Plants to avoid:</b></p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Dead or dying plants: decomposing plants will affect the water quality in your aquarium.</li>\r\n<li>Duckweed: although not hazardous, this floating aquatic plant tends to be a nuisance, blocking out light entering your tank. We would advise avoiding duckweed altogether but, if you do decide to introduce this plant, prune regularly.</li>\r\n<li>Newly fallen branches: driftwood is a common addition to aquariums. However, branches that have fallen recently from trees may contain harmful resins or compounds.</li>\r\n<li>Pine branches: this wood is dangerous for your aquarium and may be home to organisms you do not want entering your tank.</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 15:31:25', '2021-09-01 15:31:25'),

A groomer’s trained eye can catch some health problems early on, for example, allowing you to seek treatment as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n<p>“We know that dog parents are looking for ways to give their pet the best care and keep their health on track,” says Petco chief veterinarian Dr. Whitney Miller, DVM, MBA, DACVPM. “Regular baths and haircuts, along with routine vet exams, can help keep your dog healthy in the long run.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Importance of Dog Baths</h2>\r\n<p>Both long- and short-haired dogs can benefit from professional baths. While short-haired dogs might not need a haircut, a professional pet groomer will get a close look at your pet’s skin and coat during bath time and will alert you to any concerns. Short-haired dogs may seem a little lower maintenance in the bath department, but they have similar&nbsp; health risks as their furrier counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“Pet parents should talk to their veterinarian and groomer to determine the specific schedule of bathing and haircuts, but most breeds will need a bath every four to eight weeks and a groom every six to 12 weeks,” says Dr. Miller.</p>\r\n<p>Professional baths come with a number of health benefits, including, but not limited to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>during a haircut appointment, so long-haired dogs can expect that when they visit the salon. “If the nail is cut too short, it will be painful and bleed readily,” Dr. Giannone notes.“Very long nails will cause the digits to bend sideways, causing an abnormal gait.” He adds that neglected nail trims can result in the nail bending around and penetrating into the pad and requiring veterinary attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your dog has dark nails, cutting them without causing pain and bleeding can be difficult. “Groomers have different types of nail trimmers and spinning burrs that offer a variety of choices and make nail trimming much easier,” says Dr. Giannone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Have a dog in need of regular nail trimmings? Or need help with routine care, including baths, haircuts and convenient access to vet exams?

(130, 83, '<p><strong><em>Keep the Water Clean:</em></strong> Clean water is critical to your fish\'s long-term health. Mark your calendar to change 20% - 25% of the water once a month or more frequently if needed. This will help maintain proper pH levels and remove waste by-products such as ammonia, nitrites and nitrates.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Monitor Water Temperature:</em></strong> Like us,  fish need the right temperature (specific to their species) to thrive. Drastic temperature changes can be dangerous to their health. Be sure your heater functions properly by checking the temperature daily. A comfortable water temperature of 72- 82 degrees F will suit most aquarium fish.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Test the Water:</em></strong> You can get free in-store water tests at your local My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;store or buy kits that test the pH levels, water hardness, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates and dissolved oxygen in your aquarium at home. These are relatively inexpensive and detect potential problems so your fish stay healthy and happy.</p>\r\n<h2>The Hidden Causes of Algae</h2>\r\n<p><em>The Biggest Cause of Algae Growth is <strong>Overfeeding!</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Here\'s a tip for healthy meals:</strong> Feed your fish their recommended (nutritionally complete) diet one to two times a day, but don’t offer more than they can consume in one to two minutes. Uneaten food falls to the bottom of the tank and stays hidden among gravel, rocks or aquatic plants. In a short time, it starts to decay, disrupting the Nitrogen Cycle needed for a clean tank. Algae spores feed off the nutrients present in the food and begin to grow. Thus, it\'s this excess food that feeds algae, not your fish.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Add Some Plants:</em></strong> Live plants are a great addition to your aquarium. They provide shelter and hiding places, and also contribute to a healthy aquatic environment. They use nitrate from fish waste to grow and, in turn, give off dissolved oxygen that fish need to breathe. Remember to use fertilizer, remove dead leaves and change the full-spectrum lights every 6 to 12 months.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Give Your Tank a Monthly Scrub:</em></strong> Keep your pet\'s home tidy with monthly cleanings. Even the cleanest tanks have some algae and debris — they accumulate on the sides of the tank, in tubing and filters, and on accessories. No chemical cleaners are needed (they can be dangerous to your fish); just use lukewarm water. Occasionally, dismantle filters and lift tubes to remove clogged debris as well. Stiff brushes come in every length and diameter and make it easy to clean every nook and cranny. Magnetic cleaning blades or scrub brushes with long handles help you stay dry while removing stubborn algae from the tank\'s sides.</p>\r\n<p><em>Keeping up with these simple tasks will help keep your little swimmers happy and healthy!</em></p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 15:33:02', '2021-09-01 15:33:02'),

Most of the same things you do — good things to eat, a healthy environment and a home, or tank, of their own that meets their needs and yours.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, different fish have different needs. So consider this guide a starting point for stocking up on everything your new friend will need — but make sure you talk to your vet or My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;aquatics specialist for more detailed advice.</p>\r\n<h2>A New Home</h2>\r\n<p>Selecting your fish’s new home has a few key factors:</p>\r\n<strong><em>Size</em></strong>\r\n<p>Your fish’s new home can be as grand or as simple as you want — and should be selected to make both of you happy. Coldwater species like Betta (Siamese fighting fish) live happily in small open bowls at room temperature, but other types of fish may require a little more space. Different kinds of fish may require different sized tanks to live in — make sure to ask at your My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;aquatics specialist if your new friend has any special requirements.</p>\r\n<strong><em>Temperature &amp; Lighting &amp; Filtration</em></strong>\r\n<p>Just as you want your house heated and cooled for your needs, fish also want to live in an environment that is comfortable for their species. A thermometer to monitor the water temperature and a heater to maintain constant warmth will be important to some fish — make sure to ask a My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;aquatics specialist what the ideal temperature needs for your fish will be.</p>\r\n<p>You may also want to consider tank lighting, especially if you plan to include live plants in your aquarium. Some types of tank hoods have lighting included with the unit, providing both light and warmth.</p>\r\n<strong><em>Decorating</em></strong>\r\n<p>Decorating your fish’s tank is not only fun for you — it’s creating a stimulating environment for your new friends to live in.

Your hamster will spend most of her life in her habitat, so, before making any purchase, consider:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Size.</strong> The smaller the hamster, the smaller the habitat needed and the reverse. Make sure the habitat you select is appropriately sized for your hamster. There should be plenty of room for your hamster to exercise and play.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Type.</strong> Your hamster’s habitat should be made out of plastic, wire/bar or glass. To ensure that it’s comfortable on your hamster’s feet as well as escape-proof, you’ll want to look for a solid bottom and minimal wire/bar spacing.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ease of cleaning.</strong> You should clean out soiled bedding daily, replace all bedding weekly and give her home a complete wash once a month. To do so, you’ll want to select a habitat that is easy to dismantle and clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Location.</strong> Where are you going to place her new home? Hamsters acclimate well to average household temperatures, but do not do well with extreme temperature changes. Keep your hamster’s habitat out of direct sunlight or drafty areas.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Companionship.</strong> For the most part, hamsters are solitary creatures. However, if you would prefer a pair, consider a Dwarf hamster. Dwarf hamsters may be kept in same-sex pairs if they have been raised together, otherwise keep adult hamsters separate. Different types of small animals should not be housed together.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Setting up your hamster’s new home:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Place about two inches of bedding in her new habitat.</strong> The bedding can be high-quality paper bedding, crumpled paper bedding or hardwood shavings. Cedar-based products are not recommended.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Add chew toys, wooden blocks or chew sticks.</strong> These will keep her busy and help wear down her constantly growing incisors.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Your hamster needs lots of exercise to keep her happy.</strong> Add an exercise wheel to help alleviate boredom. You can supplement with a hamster ball for outside-habitat excursions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Water source and food bowl.</strong> Keep your hamster’s food bowl filled at all times; she won’t overeat. You may enjoy watching her stuff her cheeks with her favorite foods; she has special pouches just for that task. Add a water source and be sure to check and/or add fresh water daily.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tunnel or hideaway.</strong> Hamsters like to have a hiding place.

(136, 87, '<p>Gnawing on a mattress spring may sound painful to us humans, but your hamster has no problem eating their bedding. So that’s exactly why it’s important to purchase digestible and non-fibrous bedding material. The following are commonly used:</p>\r\n<strong>Pelleted/chipped paper product litter</strong>\r\n<p>Litter made from paper products, wood, vegetables or grain is absorbent and generally considered the safest type of bedding for your hamster.</p>\r\n<strong>Shredded paper</strong>\r\n<p>Shredded paper (such as paper towels and plain paper) is OK if you’re in a pinch. However, this type of bedding is not absorbent and stays damp easily. Avoid shredded newspaper all together; the ink can be hazardous.</p>\r\n<strong>Timothy hay</strong>\r\n<p>Timothy hay or dried grass can be a suitable bedding source, but make sure that any natural material used is chemical-free.</p>\r\n<strong>Wood shavings</strong>\r\n<p>Wood shavings are a common bedding source, and Aspen shavings are recommended most for your little one. Stay away from Cedar shavings, as they can cause nasal and bronchial irritation for your hamster</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other materials</strong><br>\r\nShredded cardboard can be a safe bedding source, but it can also be coarse and uncomfortable for your hamster. It’s a bad idea to use fabric scraps, so avoid using them at all.</p>\r\n<h2>Hamster housing and habitats</h2>\r\n<p>There is no lack of variety when it comes to setting up hamster housing. With patience, you can even go beyond housing, and build an entire city for your furry friend. From lavish mansions to quaint cottages, consider these points when picking up your hamster’s home: </p>\r\n<strong>Aquariums</strong>\r\n<p>Although hamsters aren’t exactly strong swimmers, aquariums without water make great homes for these little guys. If you decide to use an aquarium as your hamster\'s home, make sure you cover it securely with a screen cover, or a ventilated plastic top designed specifically for this purpose. Today, most plastic covers have modifications to hold add-ons, such as tubes or hanging water bottles. An important side-note here is that you should never use a solid cover for any sort of aquarium; ventilation becomes limited for your little guy and condensation will start to form inside the aquarium. </p>\r\n<p>Aquariums also have the advantage of being leak proof, so shavings and bedding stay nice and contained. Water bottle holders are available and can hold a water bottle with a plain screen cover. The major disadvantage with aquariums is that they are more difficult to clean than other habitat styles. When looking at proper equipment for an aquarium, freestanding exercise wheels are a usual favourite.</p>\r\n<strong>Hamster habitats</strong>\r\n<p>There are a variety of hamster habitats to ensure your companion has just what it needs to live a long, happy life. Some habitats have a plastic base topped with a rigid snap-on wire cover. These habitats come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and sometimes come equipped with exercise wheels. Although a little plain compare to flashier options, these cages are relatively inexpensive and highly customizable with various hamster furnishings and toys. Additionally, air-flow in these cages is better than in an aquarium. </p>\r\n<p>Hamsters feel safe and secure when they have a hide-out, so it’s a wise idea to give your hamster a home within a home. Many hamster cages come pre-equipped with a hide-out, but if not, there are plastic, wood or ceramic houses available on their own. Sometimes, using a cardboard box or toilet tissue roll works just as well. </p>\r\n<strong>Modular habitats</strong>\r\n<p>Clear, plastic tank-like habitats designed for hamsters have plenty of customizable options and add-ons available. These structures can seamlessly combine home-life with exercise as your hamster travels through tunnels, tubes, spinners or anything else your heart desires. This style of housing most closely simulates the tunnelled environment in which hamsters naturally live in. </p>\r\n<p>Hamster habitats with tubes can be great for your little one, but they can also be more work for you. These playful contraptions can have hard to reach spaces that could make cleaning tough. If you do buy a modular habitat for your hamster, always make sure that the connecting tunnels are large enough for your hamster to pass through easily. Also be aware that these cages can sometimes be destroyed by your buck-toothed buddy, and hard on your wallet. </p>\r\n<strong>Size</strong>\r\n<p>Nobody likes cramped quarters, so your hamster\'s home should at least be large enough for an exercise wheel, a sleeping area, a food-hoarding area and a toilet area. There should also be plenty of left-over room for you little guy to scamper about. Also remember, when it comes to habitats, bigger is usually better. </p>\r\n<strong>Safety</strong><br>\r\n<p>As a pet parent, you have to keep your little guy safe, and hamsters have some special concerns: </p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Ensure your hamster\'s habitat does not have any sharp edges. </li>\r\n<li>A habitat’s door or top should close firmly to make sure your hamster can’t push it open and escape.</li>\r\n<li>Doors should always open outward. </li>\r\n<li>If you are using an aquarium with a screen cover or plastic top. Make sure that the top fits snugly over the sides so your hamster can\'t squeeze out. </li>\r\n<li>If your hamster\'s habitat is plastic, make sure that there are no exposed edges that could be chewed through</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 15:54:42', '2021-09-01 15:54:42'),

Since hamsters are small, you’ll want to make sure they don’t get too cold, so always use lukewarm water (never hot) and keep them out of drafts while they dry.</p>\r\n<h3>Dust baths for hamsters</h3>\r\n<p>Dwarf hamsters can also benefit from something referred to as a dust bath. To perform a dust bath, provide your hamster with a small dish of small animal dust for them to roll around in on their own. A dust bath will help your hamster remove oils and moisture from their fur in a natural way. Don’t leave the dust bath in their habitat for longer than 12 hours at a time. Dust baths also are a type of enrichment and can give your hamster a fun activity.</p>\r\n<h2>Hamster grooming needs</h2>\r\n<p>Besides the occasional spot or dust bath, your hamster will have some other grooming needs, as well. These include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Brushing</strong>: Long-haired Syrian hamsters — often referred to as Teddy Bear Hamsters — benefit from a weekly brushing to help remove wood shavings, food and dirt that might get stuck in their coat. Use a special small animal comb or a soft, fine toothbrush.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Nail checks</strong>: Most hamsters don’t actually need to have their nails trimmed, but if you notice your hamster scratching themselves during self-grooming, or if their nails have started to curl, consult with a veterinarian about what to do.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Teeth checks</strong>: The health of your hamster’s teeth will be very important, since they never stop growing. Provide plenty of animal chew sticks and toys for your hamster to wear down their constantly growing teeth, and if a tooth ever becomes overgrown, broken or chipped, a visit to their veterinarian is essential.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Skin care</strong>: As hair helps retain skins natural oils, hairless animals often need a very small amount of coconut oil or unscented baby oil rubbed into their skin to help prevent dryness and maintain healthy skin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How to clean a hamster cage</h2>\r\n<p>Just as with all pets, it’s important to keep your hamster’s home clean to keep them healthy and comfortable. This includes daily, weekly and monthly maintenance routines to keep everything fresh. A good hamster habitat cleaning routine will include the following steps:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Scoop out soiled bedding every day</strong>. Hamsters usually urinate in one or two specific corners of their habitat, so scoop out any wet bedding every day and replace it with fresh bedding. A small animal scoop can help with this task.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clean food bowls and water bottles daily</strong>. Just as we’d like clean dishes, so would your pet. Clean containers are a basic requirement for maintaining your pet\'s health and help reduce the chance of contaminated food and water.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Replace bedding weekly</strong>. Besides scooping out dirty bedding every day, plan to change out all of the bedding in your hamster’s habitat once a week. This includes removing any food your hamster may have stored throughout the week, as well.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Wash the entire habitat once a month</strong>. Your hamster’s habitat should be deep and thoroughly cleaned at least once every month. Place your hamster in a safe, temporary habitat, such as a critter carrier while you perform your deep clean. This will include clearing out all of the debris and washing the habitat, hideaways, accessories and hard toys with lukewarm, soapy water, taking special care to avoid any potentially harmful ammonia-based products. To ensure you’re washing your pet’s items with a safe product, you can consider a specialized habitat cleaning spray. Then, thoroughly rinse the habitat with water to remove any residue, and let it completely dry before adding fresh bedding back in.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Providing your hamster a clean habitat and the items they need to maintain their grooming routine will help them remain healthy and happy. </p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 15:58:21', '2021-09-01 15:58:21'),
(139, 89, '<p>A clean rabbit is a healthy rabbit. The same goes for hamsters, rats, mice, gerbils and guinea pigs. And a clean habitat keeps your home smelling fresh. Here are some tips that will help keep your pets healthy and your house smelling great:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dishes and Water Bottles:</strong> Take your small animal’s dishes and water bottles from filthy to fresh with a good scrubbing with hot, soapy water. For faster cleanup, loosen any hardened/stuck on foods by soaking overnight. Always use separate rags/towels to wash your pet’s dishes and bowls. Prefer to use the dishwasher? Remove dried-on food first, then load with your other dishes. The heat of the dishwasher will sterilize the dishes and bottles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Have two sets of food dishes and water bottles available. That way, one set can be in use while the other set is being washed. Stainless steel or ceramic bowls are an excellent choice because they are durable, won’t stain, are easy to clean and are dishwasher safe. Also, your small animal cannot chew them or otherwise destroy them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Toys:</strong> Many small pet animals, such as mice, rats, gerbils and hamsters, like to chew. Be sure to provide plenty of chewing options, from wooden chew toys and sticks to cardboard tubes and tunnels. Remove soiled/damaged toys regularly. Toys that can withstand washing should be cleaned with mild soap and water.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Habitats:</strong> Your small animal will likely relieve itself in one or two corners of its habitat. Scoop out the soiled bedding daily and replace with fresh bedding. Change your pet’s bedding once a week, making sure to remove any food that your pet may have stored, hidden or otherwise not consumed. His habitat, nest box, hideaways and toys all should be thoroughly washed once a month in hot, soapy water. Also, completely disinfect his habitat by adding two to three drops o bleach to one gallon of water, then immerse or wipe the cage, dishes and toys with the solution. Thoroughly rinse all items with hot water to remove all traces of bleach.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> For your pet’s health and safety, discard any toys or hideaways that have become broken, chewed, or have sharp edges. Cardboard tunnels make fun chewing/hiding toys for rats and hamsters, and are easily discarded when cleaning their habitats.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 16:05:00', '2021-09-01 16:05:00'),

(141, 91, '<p>As you welcome your new guinea pig into your family, you want to make sure they feel right at home. The best way to do that is by creating a cozy environment for your new pet to live. Since your guinea pig will spend most of their time, in a habitat, it is important to create a safe and welcoming home for your pet. By properly setting up your guinea pig’s new habitat, they will be on the right path for their physical, mental, social and emotional needs to be met.</p>\r\n<h2>Selecting a habitat</h2>\r\n<p>Your first decision is which habitat to purchase. Because you don’t want your guinea pig to get their toes stuck, avoid habitats made only of wire, or those with a mesh wire floor. Instead, purchase a habitat that is either plastic, metal or a combination of wire with another material. Make sure that the bottom of the habitat is solid plastic or plastic covered wood.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to the size of a guinea pig habitat, bigger is better. <a href=\"http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/guinea_pigs/tips/guinea_pig_housing.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Humane Society of the United States</a> says that guinea pigs that are in small habitats are at risk of developing medical conditions, and depression, and more likely to fight with other guinea pigs in the same habitat. It is also much easier to clean a larger habitat because, if space allows, guinea pigs will contain their waste to one section of the habitat. <a href=\"http://www.guineapigcages.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GuineaPigCages.com,</a> a website recommended by the Humane Society of the United States, recommends that a habitat for a single guinea pig be at least 7.5 square feet and ideally 30\" x 36\". For two pets, the ideal size is 10.5 square feet. Three guinea pigs should have 13 square feet. The recommended size increases with each additional guinea pig that lives in the habitat.</p>\r\n<h2>Accessorizing your guinea pig’s new home</h2>\r\n<p>Luckily, making your new pet’s bed doesn’t involve fitted sheets and hospital corners. But since guinea pigs love to burrow, you need to provide at least two inches of bedding in the habitat. Because of harmful chemicals, make sure not to put cedar and pine shavings in your guinea pig’s habitat. Recommended bedding includes recycled paper mill by-products, pelleted litter made from aspen bark or pelleted litter made from recycled paper fiber.</p>\r\n<p>On top of the bedding, set a nesting box for your guinea pig to use for some quiet time. Many pet parents also put a bed for sleeping in the cage, such as a lamb’s bed. You can also put a nest box in the cage instead of a bed. Since guinea pigs have a habit of chewing plastic, use earthenware or metal feed dishes. Many pet parents find that a water bottle is easier because it doesn’t spill or get dirty. However, to avoid having a chewed up water bottle, make sure that the straw is stainless steel.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 16:09:03', '2021-09-01 16:09:03'),

No matter what type of pet you have, some basic spring cleaning for their items should include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Scrubbing their food and water dishes: Use water and a mild soap to thoroughly wash food and water bowls. This should actually be a daily activity, not reserved just for a spring deep clean. However, it’s a good time to do a in depth check of their feeders and replace any dishes or bowls that are cracked, chipped or scratched.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Disinfecting pet toys: Your pet’s toys can be a hotbed for bacteria, dirt, yeast and mold, so cleaning them thoroughly and regularly is very important. To do so, wash all plastic and rubber toys at least once a week in warm water and mild soap. Plush toys often have care instructions on the tag, otherwise you can usually run them on a gentle cycle with mild detergent in the washing machine, or wash them by hand.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Disposing of expired products: Pet products past their due date — especially medicinal ones — have no place in your home. Take some time to go through all the pet products you have stashed in your house and toss and replace all expired items like flea and tick preventatives, prescriptions and supplements.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to these tips, specific types of animals will require additional care based on their habits and needs.

If your dog has a dog bed, be sure to clean and rotate all bedding once a week to remove dirt, bacteria, allergens and potential pests from both the bedding and your home. Follow the care instructions on the bed to keep the bed in its best shape.\r\n<p>Beds that are six months or older, or those with tears, loose stuffing or other unfixable damage, should be replaced completely. My Puppy My Pet has a full line of dog bed options for pets of every shape and size.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Cleaning out the dog crate. Your dog’s crate also needs attention. Clean out any bedding that might be in the crate and wipe the entire crate down. Repeat this at least once a month.<br>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Know when to throw out dog toys. Toys that can’t be cleaned or are simply beyond repair can become a hazard and should be thrown away and replaced. Look for ripped seams or exposed stuffing or squeakers as a sign that it’s time to say goodbye. Search tons of new dog toys at My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;to replace any beloved toy that has seen better days.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Litter box cleaning tips for cat parents</h3>\r\n<p>Along with washing their beds, cats require a few additional cleaning needs, especially with regard to their litter box.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Scoop litter daily: Cats with dirty litter boxes may find other places to relieve themselves. Do your cat (and yourself) a favor by keeping their litter box clean with daily scoops to remove any deposits.</li>\r\n<li>Clean the entire litter box weekly: Daily refreshes to the litter box are great, but to keep it in tip-top shape, replace all the litter inside at least once a week (more if it gets particularly dirty), and wash it out fully with a mild soap and water.</li>\r\n<li>Fully replace the litter box at least once a year: As attentive as you are to your cat’s litter box, a lot happens in there, and it’s best to actually replace the entire thing about once a year. My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;has a wide variety of cat litter box options, ranging from enclosed or self-cleaning to traditional or hooded.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>And, while cats may not tear apart their toys in quite the same manner as dogs, remember to replace worn or broken toys so your pet doesn’t injure themselves.</p>\r\n<h3>Bird habitat cleaning tips</h3>\r\n<p>Tiny though they may be, your bird&nbsp; — and particularly your bird’s cage — requires some extra TLC.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Replace cage linings: Your bird’s cage lining could be filled with food particles, droppings and other debris. When you clean the cage each week, take the time to replace it completely and start fresh.</li>\r\n<li>Clean out bird baths: Any bird baths in your bird’s cage should be cleaned out daily — since feathers, food, and other things can easily get caught in there — and refilled with fresh water.</li>\r\n<li>Clean the full cage and all accessories weekly: Give your bird’s entire cage and all the accessories inside a thorough wipe-down once a week using a mild soap and water.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Cleaning tips specific for your fish</h3>\r\n<p>Your fish will remain their happiest when you take the time to keep their environment at its cleanest:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Keep the water at appropriate levels: Fish require certain pH levels in their water to stay healthy, so remove 20-25% as needed to help maintain those levels and to remove any waste by-products like ammonia, nitrites and nitrates.</li>\r\n<li>Clean all tank paraphernalia: The entire tank, along with tubing and filters, should be cleaned with a mild soap and water at least monthly.</li>\r\n<li>Take care of plants: If your aquarium contains any plants, keep them healthy by using fertilizer, removing any dead leaves or plant parts and changing the full-spectrum lights every six to 12 months.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Sprucing up your small animal’s space</h3>\r\n<p>Small animals come with big responsibilities, especially when it comes to cage care.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Provide fresh bedding: Scoop out any soiled bedding on a daily basis to make a clean and fresh living environment.</li>\r\n<li>Take care of food and water bowls: Anything your small animal uses to eat or drink from should be thoroughly cleaned with mild soap and water on a daily basis.</li>\r\n<li>Wash their habitat: Take the time at least once a month to thoroughly clean out and wash the entire habitat — and all accessories — with mild soap and water.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>While our pets require and deserve a tidy environment year-round, spring gives us the perfect excuse to really up our animals living arrangements by ensuring everything is clean and fresh for the new season.

To avoid upset tummies during what can already be a stressful time, be sure to have a supply of the same food your puppy has been raised on ready at home. Once they’ve settled in, talk to your veterinarian about the best food options for your puppy and their specific needs. Your veterinarian can recommend puppy-specific formulas and advice about how to switch their food over time.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Puppy treats</strong>: Puppy treats play a big role in training your new companion. Look for treats that are soft, chewable and low in fat and calories. Remember that while treats help build a bond and reinforce positive behaviors during training, they shouldn’t make up more than 10% of your pet’s overall diet.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Food and water bowls</strong>: Your puppy should have dedicated food and water bowls. While you may put out your puppy’s food bowl only at mealtimes, fresh water should always be available. If you find your puppy eats too fast, consider a slow-feeding bowl, designed to help your puppy eat at a more appropriate pace.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Collar, harness, leash and I.D. tag</strong>: Walking your new puppy is a great way to get active and helps your puppy socialize and learn leash-walking manners. You’ll need a secure and sturdy leash and collar before you get going. If your puppy pulls, ask a dog trainer or a store partner about alternative options that can help discourage the behavior. Collars should be adorned with a filled-out identification tag that includes your puppy’s name and your contact information.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Crate</strong>: House training is a big part of new puppy parenthood, and it requires patience and dedication. Crate training allows your puppy to have a safe-feeling place of their own in your home while also helping to minimize accidents on the carpet and inappropriate chewing on unattended shoes and other items. Plan to crate your puppy whenever you cannot watch them, including when you’re out of the house&nbsp; at work and overnight while you’re sleeping. Learn more about crate training methods to help your puppy.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cleaning products</strong>: Puppies don’t usually come fully potty trained, so new pet parents should anticipate accidents. Look for an enzyme cleaner to help remove urine stains, and stick to pet-safe cleaners. Be prepared for shedding and dog hair in your home. Vacuums with pet-hair extensions or capabilities can come in handy.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Puppy toys</strong>: All dogs need mental stimulation, and toys are a great way to play and interact with your new puppy. Look for toys designed for puppies—they’re usually smaller and work better with their puppy teeth—and consider interactive treat toys and puzzle toys to keep your puppy engaged and busy. Dedicate time in your day for playing and building your bond.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Dog bed</strong>: Although your puppy may sleep in a crate at night, it’s important to buy your puppy a dog bed. Your puppy can rest on the bed during the day, and it can be another place they know is theirs and available to go to for breaks. When looking for the right dog bed, be sure to get one that can accommodate your puppy’s breed and size as they grow while also keeping in mind that some puppies may decide to chew their bed if left alone. A throw blanket or bed made of durable material may be best for teething puppies - along with supervision.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Shampoo and grooming tools</strong>: Even if you plan to take your puppy to grooming appointments, you should have basic grooming products at home. Dog-friendly shampoo, a comb, a brush, nail clippers and styptic powder are essential tools to have on hand. When bathing your puppy at home, always use a shampoo designed specifically for dogs. Never use human shampoo on your puppy.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Medications and preventive measures</strong>: Talk to your veterinarian about any medications and preventives your puppy should have. These could include flea &amp; tick prevention and a monthly heartworm preventive.</p>\r\n<h2>Puppy training tips</h2>', 'storage/1630496850.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-01 17:47:30', '2021-09-01 17:47:30'),
(153, 98, '<p>New pet parents should expect to spend ample time on training. This includes potty training, crate training and teaching new cues. Follow these tips for successful puppy training.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Always use positive reinforcement</strong>. Never hit&nbsp; your puppy when they do something wrong. Reinforcing with force can cause fear in your puppy and will not help them learn. Instead, use positive reinforcement methods, and reward your puppy with treats or praise when they do something that you ask them to do. This includes going to the bathroom outside, learning a new trick or walking politely on their leash. Staying positive will help your puppy learn behaviors quickly and effectively.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Socialize your puppy</strong>. Socialization is important for all puppies. As your puppy obtains the proper vaccinations, slowly start exposing them to different situations and new pets and people. Keep initial interactions short and build up to longer playdates. When socializing your puppy with new pets and people, always keep a close eye on them to avoid negative interactions and experiences.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Learn about dog body language</strong>. Talk to a dog trainer and brush up on dog behavioral cues and body language. Not only will this help you identify when your own puppy is uncomfortable or starting to get agitated, you’ll be aware of the body language of other dogs, too. This can help you intervene before interactions between dogs take a negative turn.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Be consistent in your training routines</strong>.

Follow these guidelines to help make the transition as smooth as possible.<br> <br><strong>Set up your home</strong>. Dedicate a room or space in your home for your puppy and their things. This space should include a feeding area and a crate. Make sure it’s close to where you and your family usually congregate e so your puppy doesn’t feel isolated and alone.<br> <br>Use puppy gates to block off potentially dangerous areas such as stairways or basements. Make sure to puppy proof your home by securing cabinets, tucking away wires and removing any toxic plants from areas your puppy can access.<br> <br><strong>Find a veterinarian</strong>. Your puppy should be seen by a veterinarian shortly after you bring them home,even if a shelter, rescue group or breeder has given your puppy a clean bill of health. Look for a licensed veterinarian in your area and make an appointment so that your new veterinarian can meet your puppy and provide a general exam.<br> <br><strong>Set up your schedule</strong>. A new puppy requires a lot of dedication and attention. Establish a routine and schedule with other family members, and designate duties so everyone knows their responsibilities. If you have to be away from your puppy for extended periods of time for work, consider hiring a trusted dog sitter, who can come to your home and let your puppy out for playtime and potty breaks.</p>\r\n<h2>Your new puppy: Additional considerations</h2>\r\n<p>Pet parents have a lot of choices to make when it comes to a new canine companion. Here are a few additional things to keep in mind:<br> <br><strong>Pet insurance</strong>: Although not everyone chooses to buy pet insurance, it could come in handy throughout your puppy’s life as they grow into an adult dog. Pet insurance can help cover veterinary visits or unexpected medical or emergency expenses. Prices for pet insurance vary depending on your pet and coverage options.<br> <br><strong>Vaccinations and licenses</strong>: Find out what vaccinations and licenses are required by your state or municipality. A rabies vaccine is often required, and many states and cities expect dog parents to obtain a dog license.<br> <br>Additionally, talk to your veterinarian about recommended vaccinations for your dog based on your lifestyle and location.<br> <br><strong>Day care</strong>: If you work a full schedule and can’t be home during the day to watch and interact with your new puppy, consider a daycare provider or bringing in a pet sitter to provide your puppy with socialization, training and stimulation during the day. Day care classes can help your puppy expend energy and learn new things while you’re at work.<br> <br>Being prepared for your new puppy’s arrival will allow you to focus on bonding with your new pet as soon as you bring them home.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 17:48:24', '2021-09-01 17:48:24'),
(154, 99, '<p>Adopting a dog is one the most exciting steps in pet parenthood, but it can also be a bit nerve-wracking. Most animal shelters have both purebred and mixed breed dogs of all shapes and sizes. Here are some tips that can help you determine which dog is the right one for you:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Evaluate your lifestyle</strong>\r\n</p><p> According to the Humane Society of the United States, it\'s important to identify the type of dog that best matches your lifestyle. Take the time to truly consider all aspects of your lifestyle, including your daily schedule, your family, your type of home, and your responsibilities. Your answers can help shape your decision:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Do I spend most of my time at home, or am I usually at work or on the go? </li>\r\n<li>Do I have time for the daily exercise that an active dog requires, or am I looking for a dog that wants to nap on the sofa with me?</li>\r\n<li>Am I interested in a grooming challenge, or would a shorthaired dog be more suitable?</li>\r\n<li>Is my home large or small? Do I have a fenced-in yard?</li>\r\n<li>Do I share my home with young children or an elderly person?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Humane Society of the United States suggests visiting a shelter, learning about the breeds, and seeking the advice of an adoption counselor before making a decision.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Evaluate the dog breeds</strong></p>\r\n<p> Every dog is an individual, but basic dog breed characteristics provide a general guideline for evaluating the suitability of specific mixed breeds for certain lifestyles.</p>\r\n<p>Looking for a high-energy dog? Consider an active breed, like a Border Collie or Border Collie mix. Don\'t have the time to devote to extensive grooming? Then cross off a longhaired breed—such as a Yorkshire Terrier, Lhasa Apso or Collie from your list. Breeds with a penchant for barking—such as the Beagle or a Beagle mix—might not be the best option for apartment-dwellers.</p>\r\n<p>Personality is always an important factor when choosing a dog, but it\'s paramount if you have children at home. While any individual dog may have the potential to be a good family dog, there are certain breeds that are noted for being particularly kind, gentle, and loving around children. The Labrador Retriever is a notable choice—it has been the most popular breed in America (based on American Kennel Club registrations) for 22 consecutive years. A number of Labrador mixes can be found in shelters and rescues throughout the country and are just waiting for their forever homes. Another perennial family favorite is the mild-mannered Golden Retriever. Be sure to check out the various retriever mixes available for adoption, and don\'t overlook the myriad of other mixed-breed dogs that are available—they are also very popular as family pets.</p>\r\n<p>If you\'re still unsure of the right breed for your family, don\'t rush. Spend time around dogs of varying breeds. Get to know their personalities, and then talk with other pet parents about their experiences. Narrow your search down to a smaller number of breeds, and then read and research as much as you can. But try to keep an open mind when visiting a shelter. Try not to limit your focus to only the breeds on your list—you might inadvertently overlook the perfect dog for your family just because it isn\'t the type of dog that you initially had in mind.</p>\r\n<p>By carefully evaluating your lifestyle and the various breeds and mixed-breeds, you\'ll be able to find a dog that will be the perfect addition to your family.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 17:50:03', '2021-09-01 17:50:03'),

So we put together this helpful new puppy checklist with some useful tips for surviving those first few weeks as a new puppy parent.</p>\r\n<h2>Purchase a Puppy Crate</h2>\r\n<p>A puppy needs a crate where they can rest, learn the house rules, and practice potty training (dogs don\'t like to soil their sleeping space). Your puppy should sleep in their crate at night and be placed there when you’re not at home or able to supervise them. However, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be allowed out for plenty of exercise. Your new puppy may take some time to adjust to sleeping in their new crate and cry out during the night, but don\'t let them out unless they need to relieve themselves.</p>', 'storage/1630497145.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-01 17:52:25', '2021-09-01 17:52:25'),
(156, 100, '<h2>Place a Toy in the Crate</h2>\r\n<p>Dog toys are a necessary part of any new puppy checklist. Many young pets like to sleep with a plush toy when they curl up in bed, because it reminds them of their littermates. Some pet parents choose to place a ticking clock near the crate because it sounds like a comforting heartbeat. Other types of dog toys, such as chew toys, squeaky toys or rope toys, can keep your puppy mentally stimulated, which will prevent boredom, whining, barking and digging.</p>\r\n<h2>Gate an Area in Your Home, and Hold Them on a Leash</h2>\r\n<p>Your puppy shouldn’t be kept in their crate all the time. A puppy needs to have space to play with you and with their toys. It’s best to gate an area where your teething puppy can\'t do any damage and be sure to have an array of teething toys available.</p>\r\n<p>When taking your puppy out of their enclosed space, use a 6-foot leash to keep them close to you so you can keep an eye on them. Hold the leash at all times, rather than tying it to something and leaving the puppy alone, which can be dangerous. This tactic can be useful while both inside and outside, to ensure your puppy isn’t sneaking off and getting into something they are not supposed to.</p>', 'storage/1630497205.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-01 17:53:25', '2021-09-01 17:53:25');

The litter box should be easy for your kitten to get in and out of and be placed in a location that is not too noisy or out of the way. You may need to experiment with litter types to see which one your kitten likes best. A litter scoop will also come in handy when it’s time to clean the box. You should have one litter box per cat, plus one additional box.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cat food:</strong> Your new kitten needs to eat! Diet changes should be made gradually to avoid an upset stomach, so start by feeding your kitten whatever food they were eating at the shelter, rescue or breeder. Once your kitten has settled in at home, talk to your veterinarian about the best diet for your new family member. They may recommend a kitten-specific formula to help with growth. Just remember that if your kitten requires a change in food to do so slowly over a 7 to 10-day period. Check out these tips on how to transition your cat to a new food.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cat treats:</strong> To encourage bonding and help with training, purchase cat treats and reward your kitten for good behavior. But keep in mind that overdoing it can lead to weight gain. Look for low-calorie options, and use treats sparingly as they should only make up about 10% of your cat’s overall diet.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Food and water bowls:</strong> Mealtime for your new kitten won’t be complete without food and water bowls. Look for small bowls initially to make it simple and easy for your small kitten to eat. You can replace kitten-sized bowls with adult-sized bowls as your kitten grows. To encourage drinking, consider a water fountain and try and keep your cat’s food and water dishes a distance from each other as cats often will not like to drink water that is kept close to their food source.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cat bed:</strong> Kittens need a space where they can curl up and take a nap. While they may choose to do this on your couch or your bed, it’s still a good idea to purchase a cat bed and encourage your kitten to use it. Look for a bed that is easy to wash and consider ones that offer your kitten a place to burrow or hide.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cat scratchers:</strong> Kittens and cats instinctively need to scratch. It’s a natural behavior that relieves stress and helps cats file their claws and mark their territory. If you don’t want your kitten scratching your furniture or curtains, place scratching posts and scratching toys throughout your home and reward your kitten with attention and an occasional when they use them.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cat toys:</strong> Your kitten will have a lot of energy, and toys can help keep your new feline family member occupied, entertained and enriched. Cats are hunters by nature, so playing with toys helps them practice those innate behaviors. Look for interactive cat toys, like wands, so you can play together and bond. Catnip toys are also a good option for playful kittens.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cat trees and perches</strong>: Cats like to observe the world from on high, and they enjoy climbing and jumping. Cat trees and window perches provide enrichment for kittens and cats and give them a place to retreat and feel safe.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Cat carrier:</strong> Whether or not you plan to travel with your cat, you still need a safe cat carrier for transporting your cat to veterinary appointments and in case of emergency. Gradually introduce the carrier to your kitten and encourage them to explore it using treats and positive reinforcement.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Collar and I.D. tag:</strong> In the event your kitten gets lost or dashes out of the house, a collar and I.D. tag can help increase your chances of a happy reunion. Make sure the collar fits your kitten appropriately and is not too tight or too loose. Breakaway collars are an ideal option! The I.D. tag should include your contact information and your kitten’s name.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cleaning supplies:</strong> Kittens usually pick up on using a litter box quickly, but you should have urine cleaners and odor eliminators on hand in the event of an accident. Look for pet-specific cleaning products that are free of harsh chemicals. If your kitten is eliminating outside of the litter box, try switching litters or schedule a veterinary visit to rule out a medical problem.</p>\r\n<h2>How to prepare your home for a new kitten</h2>\r\n<p>Kittens are curious creatures, so it’s important to kitten-proof your home to avoid accidents and injuries. Follow these tips to prepare for your new kitten.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Remove poisonous plants.</strong> Some common houseplants are poisonous to kittens and cats. Research the plants you have in your home and get rid of any that could harm your kitten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', 'storage/1630497721.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-01 18:02:01', '2021-09-01 18:02:01'),
(160, 101, '<p><strong>Secure windows.</strong> Cats enjoy looking outside. To reduce the risk of a fall, keep windows closed when you can’t supervise your kitten. If you do plan to open windows in your home, make sure all screens are tightly secured and limit your kitten’s access to sills and ledges.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Secure cabinets.</strong> Cats have a way of sneaking into places they aren’t supposed to be, and this includes unsecured cabinets. Make sure any cabinets that contain toxic or harmful cleaning products are properly closed and locked if possible.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Clean up wires and cables.</strong> Dangling objects, including electrical wires and cables, look like toys to a kitten. Use wire protectors and keep cords tucked away and out of reach.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Prepare a safe space.</strong> Your new kitten will likely feel overwhelmed and a little bit nervous when they first come home. You can alleviate some of this by creating a safe space in a bedroom or bathroom and letting them explore and get used to that area first. If you have other pets in your home, make sure introductions happen slowly.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Find a veterinarian.</strong> Before you bring your kitten home, find a veterinarian in your area where you can take your new feline companion for regular checkups. Even if your kitten has already had their first vaccinations, follow up with a veterinary appointment to get your kitten familiar with a new vet and to establish a health and wellness baseline. Your vet can also help you decide on the right food to feed your kitten and establish a pest control regime.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Other important considerations for your new kitten</h2>\r\n<p>New cat parents will have to make other important decisions about their kitten’s care. Here are some things to think about when welcoming a new kitten.<br> <br><strong>Calming aids:</strong> Some kittens experience anxiety when introduced to their new home. If your kitten seems stressed, talk to your veterinarian about diffusers that use pheromones to help minimize anxiety, or other calming aids that can help them relax.<br> <br><strong>Pet insurance:</strong> Caring for your kitten is a lifetime commitment and unexpected injuries, sickness and accidents can add up to large veterinary bills. To help with the costs of unforeseen medical expenses, consider purchasing pet insurance to cover your new kitten. Various plans are available to fit your specific needs and budget.<br> <br><strong>Flea &amp; tick prevention:</strong> Indoor cats are still susceptible to parasites like fleas &amp; ticks. Fleas can enter a home via rodents or other pets, including dogs. Humans can also carry in ticks on their clothes. Protect your cat from parasitic diseases by getting them on a flea &amp; tick preventive.<br> <br><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Talk to your veterinarian about recommended vaccinations for your cat and discuss your options. Depending on where you live and your cat’s lifestyle, your veterinarian will put together a vaccination plan that makes the most sense for your new kitten. <br> <br>Welcoming a cat into your family is exciting, and having all the right supplies and a support system around you can help smooth the transition.

(161, 102, '<p>While your cat may sometimes find a cardboard box more entertaining than a cat toy, that isn’t to say she doesn’t appreciate the real deal. Providing a variety of cat toys will not only keep your cat active, playtime also gives her much-needed quality bonding time with you. While playing, you also might see your cat’s “natural instincts” come to life through stalking and pouncing. This playful attacking or “object play” does wonders to stimulate your her predatory behavior.</p>\r\n<h2>Variety—and Access—are Keys to Success</h2>\r\n<p>Your cat will enjoy a variety of toys, but some of the usual favorites are teasers, balls, toy mice, balls, catnip-filled toys and interactive toys. Don’t leave all of her toys out after playtime; your cat may become less interested in a toy if she has easy access to it. Some toys may also have small parts that your cat could eat or choke on, so make sure you supervise playtime.</p>\r\n<p>Even the greatest toy on earth is no substitute for having a play date. Make time for play sessions once or twice a day. What’s equally important is that you stop playing once your cat seems uninterested. So what should you bring to your play date? Let’s explore your options:</p>\r\n<h2>Fishing Poles/Teasers</h2>\r\n<p>A favorite among cats and kittens, poles and teaser usually come with feathers, ribbons or other enticing items attached. Most cats love it if you animate the target, so keep the line moving and watch as she leaps through the air and performs graceful tricks. This type of play is great for sharpening your kitten’s natural skills like stalking, chasing or pouncing, without making you the prey.</p>\r\n<h2>Mice and Balls</h2>\r\n<p>Cats and kittens love small, furry toys that resemble other creatures. These toys look like prey and stimulate predatory instincts. After your cat has hunted for her toys, she may decide to bring you the kill. Praise her for a job well done to encourage more play. Always supervise your cat to make sure she doesn’t try to devour her toys. Eating these types of toys may not cause a problem right away, but watch for any signs of gastrointestinal distress and call your veterinarian if you have any concerns.</p>\r\n<p>Mylar balls, plastic balls with bells inside, balls filled with treats or catnip or even light-up balls make a game of fetch exciting and provide a great cardiovascular workout to help your cat stay active, flexible and coordinated.</p>\r\n<h2>Catnip Toys</h2>\r\n<p>Catnip is a member of the mint family and contains an essential oil called nepetalactone that can neurologically stimulate your cat. Reactions to catnip can vary: your cat may eat it, smell it, roll in it, get a sudden burst of energy or just mellow out and take a nap. When buying catnip toys, keep in mind that a kitten may not develop a sensitivity to catnip until four to six months of age, and that only 50 percent of all cats respond to catnip.</p>\r\n<h2>Scratchers</h2>\r\n<p>Scratching is a normal and usual cat behavior. Scratching helps cats remove the outer layers of their claws. This behavior acts like a cat manicure, and helps your cat mark her territory.</p>\r\n<p>Cat scratchers not only give your cat an outlet for her natural instincts, they can save your carpet and furniture from wear and tear. Types of cat scratchers vary: choose from flat scratchers, trees, condos, ramps, towers and perches in an array of shapes and sizes. Some incorporate balls, feathers or toys to catch your cat’s interest, while others provide a comfortable resting spot for an afternoon nap.</p>\r\n<h2>Interactive Toys</h2>\r\n<p>Interactive puzzle toys help mentally stimulate your cat by engaging her in play when you’re not home. Many include balls and other items that inspire your cat to chase, bat and uncover hidden items. When you are home, a laser pointer can provide hours of interactive entertainment and exercise for your cat as he tries to catch the bright laser beam.</p>\r\n<h2>Household Items</h2>\r\n<p>Cats are naturally interested in common household items like string, twine, rubber bands, ribbon, paper, tissue, buttons, marbles, balloons, tinsel and aluminum foil, but they aren’t safe options. Your cat could easily swallow these items, and if they get stuck in her stomach or intestines, surgery may be required.</p>\r\n<p>Also, get to know your cat. If you notice that your cat stalks the electrical cords in your house, you may want to invest in cord protectors. Doing so will limit the chances of your cat chewing through the cords and getting burned, shocked or electrocuted.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 18:03:56', '2021-09-01 18:03:56'),
(162, 103, '<p>As a pet parent, you’re likely aware of the problem of feline obesity as well as the news stories about recalled pet treats. For these reasons, it’s sometimes hard to determine the best choices for giving treats to your cat or kitten. What kind of treats should you give them? How often? Every day? Not at all?</p>\r\n<p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) recommends that treats should account for less than 5 percent of a cat or kitten’s overall daily nutrition, so moderation is important. But it’s widely accepted that treats are an excellent tool for cat training or earning their trust, and it’s natural that you’ll want to provide your cat with an occasional treat from time to time.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s check out five creative ways to treat your cat or kitten:</p>\r\n<h2>Commercial cat treats </h2>\r\n<p>A wide range of cat treats are available on the market, which means that you have plenty of choices when browsing store shelves or online. The variety of options might seem overwhelming—there are weight-management treats, all-natural treats, hairball management treats, dental treats, grain-free treats, and many others—but most importantly, you’ll want to thoroughly read the ingredient label so that you’ll know exactly what you’re feeding your cat. Premium cat treats tend to have higher quality ingredients and offer more nutrition than less-expensive versions. </p>\r\n<h2>Homemade cat treats</h2>\r\n<p>Don’t underestimate your skills as a cat treat chef! It’s not hard to make your own homemade cat treats, and the process provides you with the benefit of knowing every ingredient that is included in the treats. Browse the internet for cat treat recipes. You might be surprised by the number of delicious options that your cat or kitten could enjoy and the fun that you can have creating the treats. (You’ll want to minimize your cat’s intake of salty ingredients, so be aware of this while preparing treats.)</p>\r\n<h2>Simple cat treats</h2>\r\n<p>Cat treats don’t have to be complicated. Sometimes a simple approach is best. While fruits and vegetables should only be fed in extreme moderation—a tiny bit of broccoli, banana, or corn, for example—they can provide a diverse alternative to other types of cat treats. But don’t inadvertently feed your cat something that could be potentially toxic. Cats should never be fed chocolate, grapes, raisins, tomatoes, avocados, or onions. </p>\r\n<h2>Think outside the box</h2>\r\n<p>When you want to reward your cat, it’s easy to automatically think of a treat, but time spent with a toy can be just as rewarding to a cat. Surprise them with a new toy on occasion, or look for objects that can double as a treat and a toy. For example, an ice cube can make a fun treat for your cat, especially on a hot summer day. It provides delightful entertainment for your cat as they chase it around the room. </p>\r\n<h2>Provide quality time</h2>\r\n<p>For a change of pace, occasionally exchange a high-calorie treat for one that won’t add unnecessary pounds to your cat—give them your undivided attention! Spending quality time with your cat can increase your mutual bond and provide a unique reward that can’t be matched by any snack.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-01 18:05:01', '2021-09-01 18:05:01'),

(164, 104, '<p>Guinea pigs make great small pets for a number of reasons. Their smaller size makes them perfect for children (as long as they are taught proper handling and care) or more urban spaces with less outdoor areas, and they don’t tend to be as fragile or skittish as other small pets, like rabbits or hamsters.</p>\r\n<p>There is no doubt that guinea pigs make great pets, but despite their cuddly appearance and small stature, this animal comes with its own set of special needs. Taking proper care of a guinea pig requires research and dedication. Here’s what you need to know to keep your new guinea pig happy and healthy.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Set the scene for a proper home.</h2>\r\n<p>Your guinea pig, while small (most are around eight to 11 inches in length), requires some thoughtful consideration when it comes to habitat. Avoid direct sunlight or drafts when picking the place to put your guinea pig hutch, and a minimum 36”L x 30”W x 18”H escape-proof habitat with a solid surface area and lots of room for exercise and play is recommended. Fill the home with 1 to 2” of high-quality paper bedding, crumbled paper bedding or hardwood shavings (be sure it’s a brand that’s safe for small animals).</p>\r\n<p>Guinea pigs also love to hide, so provide an enclosed area in your guinea pigs home where they can relax, as well as plenty of toys to keep them entertained. You should plan to clean and disinfect the home at least once a week with a 3% bleach solution, remove wet spots daily and completely change the bedding at least twice a week, or more if needed.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Stock up on a good food.</h2>\r\n<p>A well-balanced guinea pig diet includes a number of important things, as well as some specific no-nos. High quality, fresh guinea pig food, Timothy hay and water should always be available to your guinea pig in their habitat and should be changed out every day. From there, a limited amount of vegetables and fruits shouldn’t exceed 10% of their total daily diet, and fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C are important, since they require 30 to 50 mg of vitamin C daily. Never feed your guinea pig chocolate, caffeine or alcohol, since it can cause serious health problems. Guinea pigs who are fed a healthy diet and kept in a safe and proper habitat can live up to eight years.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Guinea pig proof your abode.</h2>\r\n<p>Since guinea pigs are social, they love to spend time out of their habitats with their family, but that requires some prep on your part. Guinea pigs like to chew on things to maintain their teeth, which grow continuously, so enclose any wires or other dangerous things in chew-proof casing and keep any sharp or important items off the ground and away from where your pet could get to them. Providing plenty of chew sticks and mineral chews will also help keep unwanted chewing at bay.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Give your guinea pig some space at first.</h2>\r\n<p>It might be hard to give your cuddly new furry friend some space when they first arrive, but most guinea pigs need some time to get acquainted with their new surroundings before they prefer to be cuddled and handled. Guinea pigs can be timid at first when they are set in new surroundings, so pay lots of attention to them in those first few days, but try your best to allow them to roam and explore on their own terms while getting the lay of the land. Once they seem settled — usually after a couple of days — guinea pigs are social animals that require daily care and attention.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Understand your guinea pig\'s actions.</h2>\r\n<p>Keeping your guinea pig healthy means understanding their typical behavior so that you can pick up on any changes that might occur and require veterinary care. Once they’re acclimated to their surroundings, guinea pigs are quite social (although it’s common for them to require some quiet hiding time in their habitat throughout the day) and love to hang out with their people. They are quite vocal and will squeak to communicate with you, as well as perform “high-jumps” in the air when they’re really happy—a behavior known as popcorning.</p>\r\n<p>Guinea pigs generally keep themselves pretty clean (with a little help from you when it comes to their enclosure) and they rarely need baths, but you should clip their nails about once a month.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Be on the lookout for any health issues.</h2>\r\n<p>Your healthy guinea pig will be active, alert, sociable and talkative, and they will eat and drink regularly. Signs that your guinea pig could use medical attention include a change in personality (becoming withdrawn or overly sedentary, for example), bathroom behaviors or a change in eating patterns. A guinea pig that is experiencing any swelling or losing weight and/or hair or has eye or nasal discharge should see the veterinarian immediately.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Pair your guinea pig appropriately.</h2>\r\n<p>As social animals, guinea pigs are happiest living with other guinea pigs—just be sure to keep same-sex pairs to avoid litters, or spay and neuter your pet.</p>\r\n<h3>Essential Guinea Pig Supplies</h3>', 'storage/1630651461.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-03 12:44:21', '2021-09-03 12:44:21'),

(166, 105, '<p>The hamster is not golden by accident. This small rodent makes one of the most popular introductory pets in the U.S. - and for good reason. Hamsters are by nature clean and easy to care for. They eat little, they are readily available through pet stores and they’re inexpensive. Most importantly, hamsters are also a playful source of entertainment.</p>\r\n<h4>Out of the desert and into your heart</h4>\r\n<p>Hamsters were domesticated in the 20th century but, if you think these little guys are just another small animal, you’re wrong. These playful critters bear little resemblance to their mice and gerbil relatives and look more like miniature bears. Their inborn behavior comes directly from habits crucial to surviving in extreme climates. </p>\r\n<p>Your hamster is solitary by nature. After three or four weeks, mothers will drive their children to independence with tiny nips. Hamsters don\'t need, want and should not have, fellow hamster companionship. Your hamster much prefers the company of humans.</p>\r\n<h4>Watch those whiskers</h4>\r\n<p>First and foremost, safety is key, and your hamster knows it too. Check out some of the heightened senses and behavior patterns that make hamsters such survivors.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>A heightened sense of smell helps hamsters identify where, who and what belong with them. Smell is also important for exploring surrounding environments.</li>\r\n<li>To compensate for weak eyesight, your hamster\'s whiskers are in constant motion. These whiskers help your hamster detect obstacles and define space.</li>\r\n<li>As a natural hoarder, hamsters can spend hours burrowing, tunnelling, and moving bits of food, bedding, and toys into certain “safe” places. They do so by way of cheek pouches that doubles the size of their head.</li>\r\n<li>Your hamster must also chew and gnaw. As a rodent, your hamster uses chewing to constantly sharpen and shorten these chisel-shaped front incisors, which grow continuously.</li>\r\n<li>Your pet is also nocturnal, and has no problem hoarding, burrowing, and exploring in the dark.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Enemies are abundant out there</h4>\r\n<p>Being skittish is also in the hamster’s nature. The hamster’s acute sense of smell alerts them of nearly everything, and you can often see your hamster rising up on their haunches, sniffing the air.</p>\r\n<p>When frightened or scared, instinct will take over, causing your little one to burrow. But, if burrowing is not an option, they\'ll puff out their cheeks, and even play dead. Never knowingly frighten your hamster. Just as in humans, fear can lead to stress, anxiety and related diseases.</p>\r\n<h4>Clean freak</h4>\r\n<p>As previously mentioned, hamsters are clean and odor free by nature. They leave a minor scent when first \"marking\" fresh territory, and females exude hormones when in heat. But, that’s where the scent trail ends.</p>\r\n<p>Rubbing, brushing, and licking can be misinterpreted as illness or parasite infestation but is most often part of your pet\'s daily ritual of keeping themself spotless.</p>\r\n<p>Many hamsters keep a clean home too. It’s common for hamsters to maintain separate food, sleep, and elimination areas but a hamster can only do so much. So, it’s important as a pet parent to supply them with plenty of fresh material, nutritious food and space to exercise.</p>\r\n<h4>Do hamsters need routine?</h4>\r\n<p>Yes, nearly all pets are happier with a general routine, especially when it comes to feeding. Being a regular caregiver through routine also helps your hamster trust you more deeply. But occasional changes of pace can help your hamster stay excited, and wards off apathy. By placing a new tube of cardboard in their cage every week, and supplying them with strange smelling items, you can help keep things fresh and exciting for them.</p>\r\n<p>An important routine your hamster should adhere to is an exercise routine. In-habitat activities are just as important as out-of-cage play, so make sure you are supplying your fur ball with plenty of interesting toys.</p>\r\n<p>Essentially, the key to a happy and healthy hamster is a balance of routine and spontaneity.</p>\r\n<h4>Choosing your hamster</h4>\r\n<p>Once you have decided to include a hamster as part of your family, there are a variety of ways in which you can easily adopt or purchase the new addition to your pet-family.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ListCircle\">\r\n<li>Look for small animal rescue agencies established near you.</li>\r\n<li>My Puppy My Pet stores have hamsters for sale.</li>\r\n<li>You can seek out a breeder if you are looking for a certain species or color of hamster. Professional pet dealers are usually glad to answer questions and offer advice.</li>\r\n<li>Look for a hamster that matches your personality and circumstances. Be sure to watch for possible signs of illness as well.</li>\r\n<li>Never use a service that sells hamsters through the mail. The transport alone is torture on the animal.</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Important questions to consider before adoption</h4>\r\n<p>The decision to adopt a hamster should be made carefully and with logic. Impulsive or spur of the moment adoption is always a bad policy when adopting any pet. There are several factors you need to consider before you become a pet parent, and these factors will help you identify important needs that must be met. Ask yourself:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Are you okay with hamsters being mostly nocturnal animals?</strong> <br>\r\nYour hamster needs a suitable place where they can sleep during the day but be noisy at night. Any disturbances during the day means stress for your hamster and could lead to illnesses or poor health.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do you have enough room for a habitat?</strong> <br>\r\nYour hamster should have as large of a habitat as possible. Choosing the right location can take time. Pick somewhere that is appropriate for you, but still safe for your hamster.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Are any family members allergic to animal hair or dust?</strong> <br>\r\nYou don\'t want to be responsible for them having an allergic reaction to your hamster.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who will take care of your hamster while you are away?</strong> <br>\r\nIt is relatively easy to take your hamster with you if you are traveling by car, but subjecting your pet to heat, cold, noise and drafts can prove to be harmful. You should have someone reliable take care of your hamster if need be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do you have the necessary time it takes to care for your hamster?</strong> <br>\r\nHamsters enjoy a clean habitat and fresh water daily. Properly caring for a hamster takes a little bit of work and time, which you may be short on.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do you have proper exercise equipment?</strong> <br>\r\nHamsters like to move around and should exercise every day. Having an exercise wheel in their habitat or putting them in an exercise ball can help them stretch their legs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If you have other pets, how will they react to a hamster?</strong> <br>\r\nIf you already have pets, you should ask yourself if a hamster would be safe in your home.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you afford the cost of owning a hamster?</strong> <br>\r\nFood, supplies, equipment, veterinary bills and toys can add up. Make sure you are in a financial position to bring a new member into your family.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Have you done your homework on the needs and requirements of hamsters?</strong> <br>\r\nLearn all you can about these animals before you bring one into your home. Find out how to properly care for your hamster and be aware of habitat requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Reality check</h4>\r\n<p>Just as there are situations where a hamster makes the ideal pet, there are other instances where a hamster is not a good idea.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Immature caregivers</strong> <br>\r\nParents should not count on one of their kids to be the pet\'s primary caregiver. While a child may have the best intention to care for their pet, they can easily lose interest or become too busy. But, the hamster\'s need for care and attention remains.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surprise gifts</strong> <br>\r\nNo matter what the occasion, presenting a hamster as a gift is presumptuous and dangerous. All potential parents need to review their situation to determine if owning a hamster is a good idea for them. While the gift of a hamster may be well received in some instances, it can also be an unwanted surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Final decisions</h4>\r\n<p>After selecting the type of hamster for you, there are several factors you still need to consider.</p>\r\n<p><strong>One or two?</strong> <br>\r\nHamsters are solitary animals, and do not live in social groups. Males and females come together to mate, only to separate quickly afterwards. Even in motherhood, females spend only a few weeks with her young.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hamster encounters</strong> <br>\r\nEncounters between hamsters that don\'t know each other can result in violent fights. Remember, large cages with varied and interesting interiors are better at providing places to hide, and can decrease the chance of a hamster fights.</p>\r\n <p><strong>What if you really want to keep two or more hamsters in a single cage?</strong> <br>\r\nYou should adopt littermates that will become used to each other. Male hamsters seem to get along best. If you are interested in breeding your hamsters, be sure they are unrelated.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Male or female?</strong> <br>\r\nBoth sexes are equally good natured and agreeable. While each hamster is different, some say males hand-tame quicker and that females are more aggressive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Young or old?</strong> <br>\r\nStarting out with a young hamster will give you the longest relationship with your new companion. However, time and patience can tame a hamster regardless of their age.</p>\r\n<h4>Basic rules for choosing your hamster</h4>\r\n<p>Purchasing any pet can be an emotionally driven decision. So, when selecting your hamster, remember to choose with your head, not just your heart. Both you and your hamster will be better off that way.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Have everything ready to go beforehand so that you can welcome home your hamster without distractions. It’s important to have your hamster settle in before they have any company.</li>\r\n<li>If a child is making the selection, remember that their decision is usually based on looks and emotion. Kids can also be easily overwhelmed by too many choices, so it’s a smart idea to give them intentionally limited options.</li>\r\n<li>Choose a specific time to view your potential pet. Call ahead to the pet store, breeder, or shelter and find out when their feeding and adoption times are.</li>\r\n<li>Allowing time for an adjustment period is wise if you have other pets. Your new hamster will need to be left alone so that they can acclimate to their new surroundings in peace.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Now that your hamster is safely home. Investing in a carrying container made of transparent plastic with a barrel lid can be a wise purchase. Carriers with two handles usually work best for transporting your hamster. When transporting your hamster, it’s also important that you line the carrier with litter, tissue or hay to keep your hamster from sliding or being injured. Keep the container upright and out of the sun. This will make your furry friend feel secure.</p>\r\n<p>During short trips, it’s not necessary to feed them extra, because they usually lose their appetite due to the stress of moving. Be aware that the cardboard or paper cartons supplied by pet stores will rarely stand up to the gnawing teeth of a hamster. So, it’s best not to use them more than once.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Making the choice</strong> <br>\r\nWith careful observation and the help of the following checklist, you should be able to tell if your hamster is healthy. Before you make your final selection, thoroughly examine your hamster for the following.</p>\r\n<p>A healthy hamster should have:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>A smooth, shiny coat.</li>\r\n<li>No hair loss.</li>\r\n<li>A symmetrical body with no lumps.</li>\r\n<li>A clean anus.</li>\r\n<li>Clear eyes without any discharge.</li>\r\n<li>A dry nose.</li>\r\n<li>A steady gate.</li>\r\n<li>Teeth that are not overgrown.</li>\r\n<li> A lively disposition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>An unhealthy hamster will display:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Rumpled or dull fur.</li>\r\n<li>Caved-in sides.</li>\r\n<li>An anus smeared with feces.</li>\r\n<li>Red eyes.</li>\r\n<li>A runny nose.</li>\r\n<li>Shaky legs.</li>\r\n<li>Trembling.</li>\r\n<li>Sneezing and/or breathing with a rattle.</li>\r\n<li>Diarrhea (a clear signal of a contagious viral or bacterial disease).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It’s not a bad idea to arrange a visit to the vet on your way home from picking up your new hamster. The vet will check and make sure your little one is healthy, and can answer any other questions you might have.</p>\r\n<p>It is also important to know how to properly handle your hamster. Tamed hamsters don’t mind being handled if you pick them up around their middle with one hand, and place them in the palm of your other hand. You should form a little cave with your hands when handling your hamster. This can prevent not-so-tame hamsters from running away.</p>\r\n<p>Just like a hamster, always use your instincts when making your final selection. Common sense is your best guarantee for living happily ever after with your furry little friend.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-03 12:49:13', '2021-09-03 12:49:13'),
(167, 106, '<p>Home is where the heart is, and by putting a little extra love into your gerbil’s habitat, you could create something truly special and unique.</p>\r\n<p>Creating the right habitat starts with the right home, so make sure your final choice is designed for small animals, or you can use a tank. No matter what housing you choose, make sure to provide your little one with a ceramic or wooden box to hide in or a cardboard tube or box.</p>\r\n<p>Below are important points to consider when selecting from your gerbil housing options.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Size</strong> <br>\r\nGerbils are very active and need plenty of space to run, climb and explore. Gerbils housed in enclosures that are too small can often become aggressive and temperamental. One or two gerbils require an area that measures at least 18 inches wide, 24 to 30 inches long and 12 inches high. They also do well in a 15 gallon tank (or larger). </p>\r\n<p><strong>Safety</strong> <br>\r\nAs a pet parent, you will want to keep your gerbil safe.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Ensure your gerbil\'s habitat does not have any sharp edges.</li>\r\n<li>Their habitat door or top should close firmly to make sure your gerbil can’t push it open and escape.</li>\r\n<li>Doors should always open outward.</li>\r\n<li>If you are using a tank with a screen cover or plastic top, make sure it fits snugly over the sides so your gerbil can\'t squeeze out.</li>\r\n<li>If your gerbil\'s habitat is plastic, make sure that there are no exposed edges that they can chew into and escape.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Tanks</strong> <br>\r\nAlthough the only water your gerbil might see is inside of a bottle, tanks make great homes for gerbils. If you decide to use a tank as your gerbil\'s home, make sure you cover it securely with a screen cover or a ventilated plastic top designed specifically for this purpose. Today, most plastic covers have modifications to hold add-ons, such as tubes or hanging water bottles. An important side-note here is that you should never use a solid cover of any sort for a tank; ventilation becomes limited and condensation will start to form inside the tank.</p>\r\n<p>Tanks have the advantage of being leak proof, so shavings and bedding stay nice and contained. But, the major disadvantage with tanks is that they are more difficult to clean than other habitat styles. When looking at proper equipment for a tank, freestanding exercise wheels are a usual favorite.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Modular habitats</strong> <br>\r\nSome habitats are designed to include a series of plastic tubes. Although these habitats are suitable for hamsters, gerbils can destroy them quickly. Tubes are fine for play; it’s just not recommended that you house a gerbil in such structures. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Small animal habitats</strong> <br>\r\nThere are a variety of small animal habitats available to ensure your companion has just what it needs to live a long, happy life. Some habitats have a plastic base topped with a rigid snap-on wire cover, while others have both a plastic base and a plastic top. These habitats come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and sometimes come equipped with exercise wheels. These habitats are also affordable and customizable with various gerbil furnishings and toys. Although gerbils can live in wire habitats, this style is not usually recommended because gerbils are natural burrowers. The wire on these habitats can cause injury to their noses as they instinctively dig. Additionally, their tendency to dig will usually cause a lot of shavings to be thrown from the habitat. </p>\r\n<h4>Spinning your wheels is a good thing</h4>\r\n<p>Gerbils are the embodiment of energy, and when they don\'t get enough exercise, they can become obese and lethargic. Having the following equipment available when they arrive at your home can help make your little one less lazy and more lively.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Exercise wheels</strong> <br>\r\nGerbils have a one-track mind when it comes to running on a wheel, so welcoming your little one home with this entertaining and beneficial piece of equipment is a great idea. When selecting an exercise wheel, safety is key. The safest exercise wheels available are ones that are enclosed and without open spaces between the wheel’s rungs. Gerbils have been known to catch or break their tails and delicate legs in wheels with open spaces, so proper care must be taken in selecting an appropriate wheel. Ask an associate in-store for help choosing the best supplies for your gerbil. </p>\r\n<p>Wheels can be purchased separately and affixed to a habitat, or purchased as standalones. Many modern habitats also have safe exercise wheels already mounted inside of them, so that’s another option to consider when welcoming your little one home.</p>\r\n<p>The appropriate exercise wheel size is usually around seven inches in diameter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Runabouts</strong> <br>\r\nToday, there are many other exercise accessories available for your gerbil. Take a closer look at a few of the most popular options below. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Exercise balls</strong> <br>\r\nThese are plastic see-through gerbil balls that come apart, and by placing your gerbil inside of the ball, they can run freely around your home. Supervision is strongly suggested when using these toys if dogs and cats or small children are in the house and because gerbils have been known to roll their balls down flights of stairs when unsupervised. Also, make sure your gerbil\'s ball is well-ventilated so they don\'t become overheated. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Racing cars</strong> <br>\r\nThese runabouts are miniature cars that operate on gerbil power. An enclosed ball or wheel mechanism is found within the car, and your gerbil simply needs to run along to get things going. Kids love these types of runabouts, but just like exercise balls, supervision is strongly suggested when using these toys. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Tunnels and more</strong> <br>\r\nA jailbreak would be no problem for a gerbil; these little guys love to chew and tunnel. Toys such as towers, platforms, ladders, slides and spinners provide great running and climbing exercise options for your little furry one. </p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-03 12:51:12', '2021-09-03 12:51:12'),
(168, 107, '<p>You\'ve decided to get a pet bird—a new feathered companion for yourself, your family and your home. Now it\'s time to choose one. There are a number of factors to consider before you adopt or purchase a bird. These factors and the particular traits different types of pet birds have, will help you determine which is the best pet bird for your family before you bring them home.</p>\r\n<p>When you’re ready to learn more about if a pet bird is right for your family and the best type of bird to welcome home for your particular situation, keep in mind the questions below.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the time commitment for a pet bird?</h2>\r\n<p>This is probably the most important question. Birds are intelligent, playful and, most important, social animals. Are you ready to commit to the time you will need to interact with your bird? When they first come home with you, getting your bird comfortable and socialized within their new environment takes dedication – and days – to achieve. And, the work doesn’t stop there! Birds need continual stimulation in their habitats and some types of pet birds can become frustrated or bored if they are not allowed time out of their habitat every day for interaction. You should set aside a specific time for you and your bird to interact, play with toys and even work on teaching them different tricks or cues.</p>', 'storage/1630652353.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-03 12:59:13', '2021-09-03 12:59:13'),

Some species attach themselves to one family member and shower that person with all their devotion. That person may or may not be the one who loves and feeds them the most. Other birds will divide their love among all family members equally. Decide if you want a tame bird that will cuddle with you while you relax at night or if you prefer a bird that remains in his habitat most of the time. Some species prefer minimal to no handling, while others crave attention to the point that they will become upset if they don\'t receive it. Be sure to take that into consideration.</p>\r\n<h3>Are you ready for a messy roommate?</h3>\r\n<p>All birds make a mess. Careful planning of the habitat and surrounding area can make things neater and easier to clean. Even a potty-trained bird has accidents. And, birds also produce dander. Remember, sharing a home with a bird can be like having a two-year-old-forever.</p>\r\n<h3>How chatty is your ideal pet bird?</h3>\r\n<p>Different bird species have different \"chatters\" and noise levels. Some, like budgies, are known to chatter, while cockatiels can whistle (sometimes quite loudly) And if you’ve ever been around a macaw, you know that some can get quite loud.

Hand-fed birds may require less training and hand-taming when you welcome your new pet into your home.</p>', 'storage/1630652643.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-03 13:04:03', '2021-09-03 13:04:03'),

While many behaviors are also similar across male and female pet birds, you may notice a different in terms of the level of noise they make. For instance, female canaries are typically quieter than male canaries.</p>\r\n<p>However, identifying a male or female bird in a pet store may be difficult since special testing methods are required to differentiate between the sexes. Consult with a veterinarian that specializes in avian medicine to determine the sex of your pet bird.</p>\r\n<h3>Should you get a young bird or an older one?</h3>\r\n<p>Most bird pet parents tend to choose young birds, so they are able to train it from the start and know more about its personality. Although adopting an older bird can be more challenging in some ways, there are also rewards and advantages. Older birds may actually be well trained and friendly; and they tend to be less expensive.</p>\r\n<p>If you choose to get an older bird, be sure to check their background, and gather as much information as possible about their previous pet parent, diet, medical history, age and personality traits.</p>\r\n<p>Remember to keep your expectations realistic. Some older birds may have developed behavioral problems, such as biting, screaming or feather picking, which could be the reason the bird is up for adoption. Sometimes a bird\'s problems will moderate, or even disappear, in a new environment; a lot of TLC can help with that. Other times though, some birds will retain their habits for the remainder of their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Patience is an important requirement if you adopt an older bird. Some may bond with you right away, while others may take months. Some previously owned birds may have been neglected by uncaring owners or due to ignorance. Worse yet, some may have been abused. Birds raised under these circumstances will most likely require an extra dose of TLC to adjust properly.</p>\r\n<p>Some older birds may require a dietary change. This should be made gradually so that you can be sure your bird is eating enough to maintain a healthy weight. Although an older bird may be finicky, continue to offer the new food to him. Even if he refuses to eat it at first, he may come around eventually.</p>\r\n<h3>Should you get one or two pet birds?</h3>', 'storage/1630652731.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-03 13:05:31', '2021-09-03 13:05:31'),
(174, 107, '<p>The answer to this question cannot be made without careful consideration and planning. Keep in mind that:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>By nature, birds are flock animals, forming strong bonds with other members and raising birds in pairs can help foster their flocking instinct.</li>\r\n<li>If you purchase or adopt a pair, they may bond to each other, and not to you. If you were looking to create a special connection with your new pet, or wanted to train him to talk, you may want to consider one vs. two.</li>\r\n<li>If two birds are kept in the same habitat, one will prove to be more dominant, which could lead to problems.</li>\r\n<li>If you are looking to have multiple birds, it is important that the species should be the same, so keep canaries with canaries, parakeets with parakeets, and so forth.</li>\r\n<li>The younger the birds, the greater the chance of successful mixing. So, introducing multiple birds sooner rather than later is a good idea, but introducing an older bird may be more difficult.</li>\r\n<li>Introducing a new pet to an existing one doesn\'t always work out; birds have their own personal preferences and might not be compatible with one another.</li>\r\n<li>The birds should be allowed to get to know each other from separate habitats initially; within a short time you can begin to move the habitats together.</li>\r\n<li>The birds\' first encounter should be outside their habitats; observe their behavior and be prepared to separate them. Never leave the area until you are certain the two birds will be compatible.</li>\r\n<li>Even if your birds cannot occupy the same habitat, they can still enjoy each other\'s company.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Should you get a bird with or without leg bands?</h3>\r\n<p>Most commercially sold birds will have metal bands around the lower portion of their legs. These bands are used for identification and to indicate where your bird was bred. These bands will become very important if your bird should get out of their habitat.</p>\r\n<p>The decision to remove the band is not a simple one. Closed bands should never be removed because they serve as the bird\'s birth certificate. However, removing open bands may help prevent injuries because bands can catch on habitats, wires, toys, and other objects. If your bird\'s leg is injured and swells, the band can cause additional damage. If you decide to remove the band, never do it by yourself; have your avian veterinarian remove the band. Be sure to save the band, or copy the information, for safekeeping.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Picking out your pet bird</h2>\r\n<p>Purchasing any pet can be an emotional decision. When selecting your bird remember to choose from your head, not just your heart; both you and your bird will be happier for it.</p>\r\n<p>To ensure that you have enough time to make a good decision when picking out your new pet, call ahead to the pet store, breeder or shelter and find out when their feeding and adoption times are so that you have ample opportunity to observe and interact with potential birds.</p>\r\n<p>If a child is helping make the selection, remember their choice is usually based on sight and emotion. They also can be easily overwhelmed by too many choices. If it is vital for your child to pick the pet, pre-select several options based on which pet would fit best into your family’s lifestyle and let your child choose from these options.</p>\r\n<h3>Making a Healthy Choice</h3>\r\n<p>With careful observation and the help of the following checklist, you should be able to tell if the particular bird you are singling out is healthy. A healthy bird should look alert when you approach them, those that appear dull and have fluffed-up feathers may be ill. Don\'t be misled by the plumage of a young bird, as young bird’s feathers rarely are as sleek as adult birds.</p>\r\n<p>Other health factors you should pay attention to include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Nostrils should be even in size and free of blockages</li>\r\n<li>Eyes should be clear, without discharge or a whitish opacity</li>\r\n<li>Bill should be a normal length with no signs of abnormality, such as the upper portion curving into the lower</li>\r\n<li>The feathering around the bill and on the head should be clean</li>\r\n<li>Locate your bird\'s breastbone by running your fingers down his underside to the mid-line; distinct hollows on either side indicate poor condition, possibly a result of a chronic illness.</li>\r\n<li>Legs should be smooth; heavy scaling can be a sign of old age</li>\r\n<li>Overgrown claws will require clipping</li>\r\n<li>Check for swelling on the bottom of the feet, the result of a bumble foot infection</li>\r\n<li>Your bird\'s toes should all end in claws, although on occasion, a claw may be missing</li>\r\n<li>Check the vent area for soiled feathering that could indicate a digestive disturbance</li>\r\n<li>Feces color can vary depending on the type of pellets the bird is eating, but lime green feces can indicate a serious health concern</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How much will your pet bird cost?</h2>\r\n<p>How much pet birds cost varies depending on the type of bird you choose. Design a budget for the pet bird you wish to get, and don’t forget all of the <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/bird\">bird supplies</a> that will also be needed. Beware of \"bargain birds\" as there could be some underlying issues. While exact prices will vary based on where you are located and other factors, you can expect costs similar to the below:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A pair of finches can cost between $20 and $100</li>\r\n<li>A budgie is usually about $25</li>\r\n<li>Cockatiels range from $80 to $150</li>\r\n<li>Amazon greys can be between $700 to $1,500</li>\r\n<li>A hyacinth macaw can command more than $8,000!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Welcoming your new pet bird home</h2>\r\n<p>Now that you have purchased your bird, you have to transport them safely home. Bring your new bird home in a box or travel bird carrier rather than in full size habitat. This will be less stressful and should help your bird settle down instead of flapping about and possibly becoming injured. Pet stores can supply suitable carriers, but if you are purchasing your bird from a breeder, you may need to bring one.</p>\r\n<p>You should arrange to visit your veterinarian on the way home from picking up your new bird. The veterinarian will check your new bird to be sure it is healthy and answer any questions you may have.</p>\r\n<p>Don\'t wait until you bring your bird home before setting up their space. Have everything ready so that when you come home you can attend to your bird. You should learn how to properly handle your bird before you attempt to put them in their habitat. The store, rescue, breeder or your veterinarian can show how to do this. Even a tamed bird is likely to be nervous, so allow your bird to settle down on their own. Allow for an adjustment period once your pet is safely in their habitat. Leave yourself adequate time for introductions if you have other pets. Your new addition will need to be left alone for a while they can acclimate to their new surroundings in peace.</p>\r\n<p>An advance in domestic breeding and rearing of birds has resulted in healthier, tame young birds. Their increased availability has made birds even more popular as pets. For many, the company of these magnificent, unique and, in some cases, talking pets can make birds an attractive family addition. </p><h3>Related Articles</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bird Guide</li>\r\n<li>Top Summer Concerns for Pet Birds</li>\r\n<li>Welcoming Your Pet Bird Home</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-03 13:06:03', '2021-09-03 13:06:03'),
(175, 108, '<p>Welcome home! As a new bird parent you may be wondering where you can find a comprehensive list of bird supplies. From a habitat, to a habitat liner, and finally perches, let this article serve as your one-stop-guide to shopping for bird supplies.</p>\r\n<h4>Go Big AND Go Home: </h4>\r\n<strong>Buying a Habitat for Your Bird</strong>\r\n<p>A habitat is your bird\'s home, and size matters. As a bird parent, you want to provide the best and largest home possible. As a general rule of thumb, try to buy the largest habitat within your budget. The number one item to note is that the habitat should be big enough for your bird. Your bird will be in their new home a majority of the time. Habitats come in a wide variety of styles, shapes and sizes. Here\'s all you need to know:</p>\r\n<p>Before shopping:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li><strong>Know your bird</strong>\r\n<p>Some birds want to be able to fly in their habitat (e.g. finches and canaries) while others like to climb, and need a tall habitat to exercise (e.g. budgerigars and parrots). This will determine if you purchase a wide or tall habitat. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Know your bird\'s size </strong>\r\n<p>Most birds are full-grown when purchased or adopted. When finding the right habitat for your new friend, your bird should be able to fully spread both wings without touching the sides of her habitat at the very least. If you adopt a bird that is unweaned, they may still have a bit of growing to do.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Know your parenting habits</strong>\r\n<p>Will your bird be in their habitat at all times, or will they be allowed out?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Consider the following safety points when shopping for a habitat:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Stability:</strong> Shake the habitat to ensure it feels solid and sturdy. Consider how the habitat will work in your home environment; if you have small children, if the habitat will fit in the area you\'d prefer, etc.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Finish:</strong> Check the habitat for any sharp edges, rough welds or unfinished metal that could cut your bird (or you). </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Small parts:</strong> Some habitats are designed as \"knock-down\" habitats. These habitats can be disassembled and flattened for storage. The hardware used to assemble them may become loose, risking the swallowing of a screw or bolt.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Latches:</strong> There are habitats designed specifically for escape-minded parrots. These have closures that are impossible for birds to open. Most parrots will play with latches, and if your habitat does not have such a tamper-proof latch, a padlock can be added to solve the problem.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Bar spacing and orientation:</strong> Ensure the width between the bars is narrower than the width of your bird\'s head, or they could get their head caught between the bars. Bars that are too close together can injure birds by trapping their feet. Horizontal bars are best for climbing, while vertical bars are less damaging to tail feathers.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Sanitation:</strong> For the sake of cleanliness and health, select a habitat that keeps your bird\'s droppings out of reach. Ensure also that the habitat has a pull-out bottom tray for easy cleaning.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Remember these stylistic notes:</strong>\r\n<p>Bird habitats range in style and material, depending on your bird\'s needs. Habitat style is completely up to you, as long as it is large enough, sturdy and safe for your bird. Habitats are made of aluminum, stainless steel, brass, wrought iron, wood, wire, plexi-glass, acrylic or a combination of materials, and each has a different features. Stainless steel is expensive, but it\'s the most durable, strongest and easiest habitat to clean. A stainless steel habitat generally lasts a lifetime. Transparent, acrylic habitats with air filtration systems have the advantage of retaining your bird\'s mess.

Habitat liners should be changed daily. Selecting the lining for the bottom of your bird\'s habitat is an important decision when it comes to safety. While habitat liners should be kept out of your bird\'s access on a regular basis, birds are known to be curious and reach for the liner regardless. Lastly, as a pet parent, it\'s important to assess the state of your bird\'s droppings when you clean the cage. Irregular bird droppings are an early sign of a potential illness. Staying on top of cleaning will also help you stay on top of your bird\'s health.</p>\r\n<p>A variety of habitat liners are available.</p>\r\n<strong>Common materials for habitat liners:</strong>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li><strong>Paper products:</strong> Available, inexpensive and safe for your bird. Newspaper, paper towels, plain paper and brown paper work best. Do not use glossy paper or paper printed with colored ink as they could contain harmful chemicals. Using paper products as cage liners makes it easy to examine your bird\'s droppings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Select shavings and pellets:</strong> Generally considered safe to use, one drawback to using them as a habitat liner is they make it difficult to examine your bird\'s droppings, as they tend to fall between the shavings and become absorbed. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Cedar shavings:</strong> NOT recommended as habitat liners because they may be damaging to birds, producing symptoms such as dermatitis, allergies and digestive problems. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Perches: Your bird\'s home base</h4>\r\n<p>Birds avoid most predators by their ability to fly. When not in flight, birds naturally perch in trees or on lofty structures, out of harm\'s way. Perches in your bird\'s new home, therefore, give your pet a sense of security. In fact, the higher the perch, the safer they\'ll feel. A perch also helps with your bird\'s exercise routine. Perches with different shapes and sizes keep your bird\'s feet conditioned. It\'s healthy for your bird to clutch in many different positions, and on different materials. As for sizing, a perch that can be totally encircled by your bird\'s foot so that the toes overlap is too small. Your bird\'s feet should only be able to get three-quarters of the way around the perch. Don\'t know which perch to purchase? See below, and take your pick or ask for advice at the nearest My Puppy My Pet. We offer a wide variety of bird perches for home use.</p>\r\n<strong>Manufactured perches</strong>\r\n<p>Manufactured perches are available in wood, mineral and plastic and in different sizes and shapes.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wood perches: generally made of a hardwood dowel and may be round, oval or square. Because many birds chew wooden perches, these may need to be replaced periodically.</li>\r\n<li>Mineral perches: helpful in wearing down the nails and beaks of birds, preventing them from becoming overgrown. These perches are also comfortable and relatively indestructible.</li>\r\n<li>Plastic perches: not recommended, because the plastic can hurt a bird\'s feet.</li>\r\n<li>Sandpaper perches: do not purchase - the sand may cut your bird\'s feet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Natural Perches</strong>\r\n<p>Branches automatically come in the varied sizes and shapes that provide healthy perching for your bird.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Commercial natural perches: Rather than risking the health of your pet by introducing a cut branch into their habitat, you can purchase commercial ones for your bird, such as Manzanita perches.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Additional Perch Perks</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Multiple perches: Although it\'s a good idea to have several perches of different sizes and shapes to provide exercise for your bird, do not have so many perches that it interferes with your bird\'s ability to move around. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Positioning of perches: Never position perches over feeding or drinking dishes, directly over one another or so close to the sides of the habitat that your bird\'s tail rubs against the bars. Try to maximize flying space within the habitat.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-06 15:03:20', '2021-09-06 15:03:20'),
(176, 109, '<p>Most pet birds are social creatures that enjoy spending time with you and your family—after all, they’re used to being part of a flock. Socializing simply means interacting with your pet bird in a way that makes them feel like a member of your family. Spending quality time is vital to your bird’s overall health and well-being, helps develop mutual trust and strengthens your bond.</p>\r\n<p>If your bird has had limited human interaction, it may take time for them to learn how to socialize with you. Birds that were hand-fed or were well-socialized as babies may be able to interact more easily and quickly with their pet parents. Either way, there are a number of steps you can take to help them feel safe and relaxed in their new home and to make socialization an enjoyable experience for both of you.</p>\r\n<h2>How to socialize your pet bird</h2>\r\n<p>“Socializing birds is not completely unlike socializing other pets, but it’s important to take note of some key differences and to focus on specific things that will make an individual bird’s transition to their forever home smooth,” says Dr. Whitney Miller, director of veterinary medicine at My Puppy My Pet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 1: Start slow</strong></p>\r\n<p>It’s not uncommon for birds in new situations to become a little timid, so the first step in acclimating your bird to their new home is getting them used to your presence and care. To do this, Dr. Miller suggests keeping movements slow and steady when performing maintenance and checking in on your bird, as quick movements and loud noises could startle them. Minimize your interactions at first and talk softly and directly to your bird to build their confidence in you. Signs that your bird is happy and gaining assurance include singing, talking or whistling. Try keeping your interactions to a minimum for a couple of days to let them acclimate and start to feel safe in their new home. Even well-socialized birds should not be taken out of their habitat the first few days in their new home.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Step 2: Introduce your bird to the (human) family</strong></p>\r\n<p>Once your bird seems comfortable in their new home and surroundings, you can begin to work on contact and direct interaction. “It’s important to have different people involved in socializing the bird,” said Dr. Miller. “Many bird species can get very attached to one person, which is called pair-bonding,” so while it’s common that your bird may take to one family member as their particular favorite, the more interactions they have with as many family members as possible, the more likely they are to be able to comfortably interact with different people. As your bird starts to vocalize and show more signs of comfort, be sure that they are also seeing more familiar faces in your home and getting used to their smells, voices and general demeanors.<br>&nbsp;<br>When introducing your bird to friends and visitors, remember that your bird is comfortable around you because you’ve established a bond with them. Depending on the species, birds that weren’t hand-fed as babies and lacked human interaction may be less likely to realize that other humans can be friendly, so it’s up to you to act as the go-between. The best way to get your bird to socialize well with other people is to expose them to various people. In some cases, your bird may trust you but still remain distrustful of others.</p>\r\n<p>Let others know that your bird doesn’t like loud, startling noises or quick movements. Allow your bird to observe new visitors at first. Let them come closer to talk to your bird only when your bird seems relaxed with the situation, and only when you are nearby to comfort them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: Introduce birds to one another</strong></p>\r\n<p>Whether your bird will be comfortable socializing with other birds depends on several factors, including the species, whether they were hand-fed as babies and whether they were introduced to other birds when they were young.</p>\r\n<p>Some birds greatly enjoy the company of others from the same species. Finches, for example, prefer to be housed with at least one other finch. Others, such as parakeets and cockatiels, can be kept alone to bond with their pet parent or in pairs to bond with each other. Different species of birds should never be housed together. However, some birds do enjoy interacting with each other outside of their habitats.</p>', 'storage/1630919229.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-06 15:07:09', '2021-09-06 15:07:09'),
(177, 109, '<p><strong>Step 4: Introduce your new bird to other animal family members</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you have dogs, cats, snakes or ferrets in your home, remember that they are naturally predatory animals. Because of this nature, in most cases, your bird should be kept separate from any pets that share your home. Any time you take your bird out of their habitat, or even open the door, other pets should first be removed from the room to avoid any situations that may frighten your bird, including:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Jumping on or pawing your bird’s habitat</li>\r\n<li>Eating your bird’s food</li>\r\n<li>Seeing your bird as a toy</li>\r\n<li>Barking or meowing, which may cause stress to your bird</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Over time, the key to helping your bird recognize that a dog or cat is just a normal part of their environment is to make sure they feel safe and not threatened in any way.<br>\r\n</p><p><strong>Step 5: Attempt some training</strong></p>\r\n<p>After your bird has been in their new home for a week, is used to their new habitat, has been introduced to all family members and seems eager and willing to interact with you more, you can start introducing some essential training techniques. For example, one of the most important cues for a bird to learn is the “step up” move. While many birds may have been taught this through handling at the location from where they came, it’s important to continue their training at home.</p>\r\n<p>To teach this move, rest your hand near the opening to the habitat, then slowly and quietly move your hand into your bird’s habitat. If your bird isn’t used to that type of interaction yet, start the training by getting them used to just having your hand in the habitat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To teach “step up”, try following the tips below:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Move your hand close to the bird at the level of their lower abdomen\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><em>It\'s important to remember that birds cannot step down so if your hand is too low, this will not work</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>If your bird does not immediately step up, gently touch their lower abdomen while saying, “step up”&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Once your bird steps onto your hand and you have them outside of their habitat, continue to alternate hands in a ladder like fashion, gently touching the bird\'s lower abdomen while saying, “step up”&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>If your bird refuses to step onto your hand, you can also use a perch to teach them to step up while continuing to work on getting them used to your hands</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Keep sessions short — 20 minutes or less — and be sure to minimize other distractions while working with your bird. Once your bird gets used to your hand in their space, you can use each session to move your hand closer to your bird until, finally, they become comfortable enough to step up on it. Dr. Miller suggests holding some food or fruit treats in your hand to entice interaction. “Once a bird feels comfortable perching on a hand or finger, that is a bird well on their way to positive human relationships,” she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>', 'storage/1630919315.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-06 15:08:35', '2021-09-06 15:08:35'),
(178, 109, '<p></p><p><strong>Step 6: Continue to reinforce socialization by introducing new activities</strong></p>\r\n<p>You can continue to work on training with your bird by talking to them so that they learn some words to mimic, and by gently petting the back of their head or along their back to help with their continued socialization and getting them used to being handled. Always use positive reinforcement when you are working on socializing or other training by praising your bird for a job well done with a few seeds, pellets, fruits or veggies.<br>&nbsp;<br>To create ongoing socialization opportunities, consider exploring some of the following activities with your bird:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Communicate with your bird as much as possible</li>\r\n<li>Interact with your bird using their favorite toys</li>\r\n<li>Play fun games such as peek-a-boo or fetch</li>\r\n<li>Watch TV or listen to music together</li>\r\n<li>Train your bird to talk or take cues</li>\r\n<li>Offer your bird portions of your daily meals that are safe for birds to eat, varying their diet will not only help improve their health, but they will learn to love mealtime almost as much as you do</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Step 7: Keep your eyes peeled for warning signs</strong></p>\r\n<p>Socializing your bird is a process that might involve some regression, so it’s important to be aware of any potential signs of backsliding. For example, concerning behaviors that may mean your bird needs some additional socialization include rushing the front of the habitat when a person is close, aggressive biting, spreading wings and vocalizing loudly. Feather-picking is often a sign of stress or behavior issues, as well. If your bird is exhibiting any of these signs after you’ve attempted to socialization, consult with your veterinarian to rule out any health issues and to determine the best way to move forward with training.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just as with any other pet learning something new, some frustration is normal, but remember that the outcome is worth it for the happiness of both you and your bird. “Behavior modification, socialization and setting birds up for success of the human-animal bond with their pet parent will take time, commitment and continual reinforcement,” said Dr. Miller.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Socializing your birds is an ongoing process that should continue throughout their lifetimes. With a little patience and perseverance, you and your pet bird can enjoy a meaningful relationship.

(179, 110, '<h4><em>Head, shoulders, fins and tail. fish anatomy 101 </em></h4>\r\n<p>Can fish see color? Do they drink water? Are you a \'fish out of water\' when friends and family ask questions about your new pets? Understanding what healthy, happy fish look like will help you be a better pet parent and spot health problems before it\'s too late.</p>\r\n<h4>Similarities and Differences</h4>\r\n<h4><em>What we have in common:</em></h4>\r\n<p><strong><em>Eyes</em></strong><br>\r\nWhile scientists don’t know everything about fish anatomy yet, it is believed that fish have eyes that work like ours. Scientists believe fish can see colors, and some even think that fish may even be able to see more colors than humans. It’s also possible that fish can see ultraviolet light, which means they can see not only what humans see, but also things we can\'t. Depending on what species of fish you have, their eyes can be located close or further away from their snout. Both are normal, and can actually give you an indication of what some fish like to eat.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Mouth</em></strong><br>\r\nUnlike humans, fish use their mouths for both taste and smell. To aid with hunting meals, fish also possess chemoreceptors on their heads and snouts, which helps them track down their food via smell. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Ears</em></strong><br>\r\nFish do in fact have ears and can hear, though they mostly hear low-pitched sounds. Their ears have otoliths, or tiny bones on top of hairs in the inner ear, which help interpret vibrations as sound. Just like your ears, the inner ear also helps your fish balance and remain upright. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Skin</em></strong><br>\r\nLike you, fish have skin, but you can probably already tell it’s a bit different from yours. It’s scaly and slimy, but it’s supposed to be that way. Like humans, fish have three main layers of skin: the epidermis (outside layer), dermis (middle layer) and hypodermis (innermost layer). </p>\r\n<p>A fish’s scales are firmly attached to the dermis or middle layer of skin. The dermis is also home to pigment scales that give your fish their bright colors. Fish have a color-controlling nerve that, if pinched, will make a fish’s color become very bright in that area. The outer layer, or epidermis, covers the scales and contains the cells that produce the natural slimy layer, which protects the fish. </p>\r\n<p>Fish don’t turn green when they’re seasick, but their skin is a good indicator of illness. Slime is good, but too much slime can mean something is wrong. Fungi, bacterial infections and parasitic infections can all affect fish skin. Healthy skin is smooth and free of bald patches, red or white spots and missing scales. </p>\r\n<p>Did you know fish have skin that—just like you—can get sunburned? Unlike humans, fish don’t turn red when their skin is burned. Instead, they begin to lose their coloring and become pale when exposed to too much light. If you notice your little swimmers are getting pale, no need to lather on the SPF; just make sure your fish tank isn’t in direct sunlight or exposed to any ultra-violet rays. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Vent and Droppings</em></strong><br>\r\nEverybody poops, even fish. While it isn’t pretty, waste can also be a clue to your fish’s health. Be sure to check your fish’s vent area to make sure it is not swollen or red and that no feces are hanging onto the vent, as this could be the sign of a problem. Waste should never be pale or bloody. Also, check the vent area for any worms, which are dark in color, tube-shaped and hang from the vent.</p>\r\n<h4><em>What we don’t have in common:</em></h4>\r\n<p><strong><em>Gills</em></strong><br>\r\nAs you probably know, fish breathe through their gills, which filter oxygen out of the water. Saltwater fish drink water through their mouths and excrete the salt through their gills. Healthy gills are extremely important and should be red with no white spots. Gills can be susceptible to a number of parasites, so check for symptoms regularly.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Fins</em></strong><br>\r\nFish fins come in a variety of interesting shapes, sizes and colors and are part of what makes your fish look so cool. Different fins on the top, bottom and sides of your fish work together to move the fish through the water and change directions. The best way to recognize healthy fins is to check for any bloody streaks or raggedness. Make sure fins are intact and that your fish can move, using them to swim and not holding them close to the body.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Air Bladder</em></strong><br>\r\nYou might wonder what makes fish float and control their depth in the tank. How do they come to the surface to eat or sink to the bottom to swim laps around sunken treasure? Fish have an internal organ called an air bladder, or swim bladder, that they can fill with gasses to control their depth. Some experts even believe that vibrations in the fish\'s air bladder may enhance their hearing. </p>\r\n<p>Now that you know what your fish should look like when they’re at their best, you’ll be able to spot a sick fish before any problems become serious.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-06 15:13:58', '2021-09-06 15:13:58'),

Are you surprised? You shouldn’t be! With engaging antics and graceful beauty, aquatic life can make a wonderful addition to your home—as long as you understand how to properly care for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you’re considering bringing aquatic life into your home, the best way to prepare is to first set up your aquarium. This, plus understanding what ongoing work will be required, will help set you and your aquarium up for success. Maintaining an aquarium can be fairly easy and stress-free, as long as you know the right steps to follow. To start, think about the below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Pick the right aquarium</h2>\r\n<p>The size of the aquarium that you need will depend on the type of fish you decide to bring home (consider if it will be a freshwater fish, saltwater fish and the individual species), and how many you will want to get. With fish tank sizes ranging from desktop aquariums for a single betta on up to a large aquarium appropriate for multiple types of fish, it’s important to put a little thought into the habitat prior to bringing home any aquatic life. Overcrowding can lead to low oxygen levels in the water, excess waste and even, in extreme cases, fatalities. Stop into your local My Puppy My Pet store for advice on which size aquarium or tank will be right for you based on your space availability and the type of fish you were hoping to get.</p>\r\n<h2>Set up optimal aquarium water conditions</h2>\r\n<p>Different types of aquatic life will require different water conditions, but for any underwater creature, a proper environment is critical. A few factors to consider include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Conditioning the water.</strong> Tap water comes with countless properties that need to be balanced in an aquarium to support aquatic life. To condition water properly, use a dechlorinating agent along with a biological aquarium supplement.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Maintaining proper pH levels.</strong> pH is an indicator of the acidity or alkalinity of your tank water. Buy a pH test kit to check the pH level. Freshwater fish typically thrive when the pH level is between 6.8 and 7.5, depending on the species, as it is the range that will offer a natural environment that helps your fish resist illness. Check regularly for fluctuations and make the necessary changes to recalibrate as a change in pH greater than 0.3 in a 24-hour period can cause a fish to become stressed or susceptible to disease.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Stabilizing temperature.</strong> Changes in water temperature can also wreak havoc on aquatic life, so never place your aquarium near a window that gets a lot of sun, or next to heating or air vents that can change water temperatures quickly. Tropical freshwater fish require a constant temperature of 72 °F – 82 °F, depending on the species. An aquatic heater will help you maintain the proper temperature.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Prepare for proper fish tank maintenance</h2>\r\n<p>Regular monitoring of the water conditions in your aquarium or tank is a good start for proper maintenance, but there are other things you can do, including regular cleanings.<br>&nbsp;<br>Plan to replace 25 percent of the water in your aquarium once a month. This will help keep your tank’s water clean and nitrate concentrations at a safe level. A gravel vacuum can help siphon out water and debris—especially that along the bottom of your tank. Keep an eye out for algae buildup, as well. This might appear as cloud on the glass of your tank, or the water itself could look murky, which will lead to decreased oxygen levels in the water. To help clean the algae from your aquarium, use a tank scrub brush or aquarium algae magnet.</p>\r\n<h2>Practice proper aquarium acclimation</h2>\r\n<p>Aquatic life can be sensitive to dramatic environmental changes, so be sure to ask the store partner what the water parameters for nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and pH levels are for the species you get, and test your setup at home to ensure that it matches as closely as possible. Once you get your aquatic life home, float the sealed bag containing your aquatic life in your aquarium for at least 15 minutes, but no longer than an hour, to allow for temperature acclimation. Open the bag and slowly add a quarter-cup of water from your aquarium. Repeat the process of adding a quarter cup of water every five minutes until the bag is full. This brings the temperature and chemistry together slowly, which allows the new aquatic life to acclimate to their new aquatic home without being shocked by sudden changes. Remove the bag from the aquarium and slowly pour off as much water as possible without exposing the aquatic life to the air. Lower the bag into the aquarium and allow your new aquatic friend to enter into their new home.</p>\r\n<h2>Observe your aquatic life for changes</h2>\r\n<p>Take a few moments to observe your aquatic life on a regular basis. Watch for changes in appearance, behavior or appetite so that you’ll immediately notice if something is amiss.<br>&nbsp;<br>With a little planning and forethought, you can prepare a well-managed aquarium before you even bring your aquatic life home. Then, with proper maintenance, you will be provided with many hours of watching your aquatic life swim in their glorious new habitat.

(182, 112, '<p>Many pet parents spend a considerable amount of time selecting the perfect fish to live in their saltwater aquarium, assuring that all of the aquatic life in the tank will be compatible. But it is also important to carefully research and select the right equipment for your saltwater tank to ensure the well-being of your new aquatic life. </p>\r\n<h2>Heater</h2>\r\n<p>You’ll need a heater to keep your tank at a consistent 72 to 82 degrees. Select a heater that is UL approved. Submersible heaters tend to be one of the best options; however they also make heaters that hang on the rim of the tank. Make sure the heater you choose has the correct capacity for your aquarium size: the general rule is 3-5 watts per gallon. </p>\r\n<h2>Filtration</h2>\r\n<p>Filtration is the heart of your aquarium. It is comprised of three main functions: biological, mechanical, and chemical. These functions help provide a clean, oxygenated environment for your aquatic life. There are a variety of filtration systems suited to meet the various aquarium sizes and needs of the aquatic life. While some of these options may seem pricey, this is one of the most important investment decisions for your aquarium.</p>\r\n<h2>Lighting</h2>\r\n<p>Proper lighting in your saltwater tank allows you to easily view your fish, as well as provide energy for live plants and corals. While incandescent lights used to be popular choice in lighting, most experts now recommend fluorescent, metal halide or LED lighting systems. One benefit of fluorescent lights is that you can select from an array of different spectrums or combine multiple spectrums in one fixture. Metal halide light systems, which produce intense light, are a good choice for tanks deeper than two feet. This type of lighting is also popular due to its ability to most closely replicate natural sunlight. LED lights also are popular because they are very energy efficient and tend to last a long time. You also can operate them from smart phones as well as create climatic and spectral features such as thunderstorms. </p>\r\n<h2>Aquarium Substrate </h2>\r\n<p>One of the ways to create a more natural looking environment is by adding a substrate. Popular choices include live sand and aragonite. A benefit of live sand is that it contains natural elements found on a reef, including nutrition sources and helpful bacteria. </p>\r\n<h2>Marine salt </h2>\r\n<p>You must use specially formulated salt for your tank. Do NOT use the salt found in your pantry! One option is commercial marine salt, which is a synthetic form of salt formulated in a laboratory. For reef tanks, you can use a product such as Reef Crystals, a synthetic salt containing higher levels of calcium and trace elements, which benefit coral reef marine life.</p>\r\n<p>Another option is to use packaged ocean water. Packaged ocean water can be purchased in 10 gallon increments and eliminates the need to mix synthetic sea salt, saving time during the water changing process.</p>\r\n<h2>Hydrometer</h2>\r\n<p>To measure the density or salinity of the water, you will need a tool such as a hydrometer. You can choose from either a floating hydrometer or a swing needle hydrometer. Floating hydrometers are calibrated at a temperature of 75ºF making it necessary to manually calculate the salinity based on temperature changes from 75ºF. Swing needle hydrometers, on the other hand, provide a specific gravity reading independent of the temperature of the water.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-06 15:18:28', '2021-09-06 15:18:28'),
(183, 113, '<p>Reptiles make fantastic pets. If you are interested in adding one to your family, it is important to determine the type of reptile that will best fit your lifestyle. You will want to understand the temperament, characteristics and care needs before diving into reptile pet parenthood. For example, habitat size, environmental requirements and diet should be considered, because different reptiles have different care needs; some will be more interactive and sociable than others. If you’re looking to make a reptile the newest member of your family, use this guide to help pick the right one for you (bonus – we also included some information about amphibians and crustaceans to consider).</p>\r\n<p>It is important to know that reptiles can carry infectious zoonotic diseases such as salmonella. These diseases can be transmitted to humans, so it’s essential to always wash your hands before and after handling both the animal and their habitat. People with weakened immune systems, the elderly, children younger than 5 and pregnant women should consider avoiding them for this reason.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of reptiles to consider for a pet</h2>\r\n<p>There are a variety of reptiles from which to choose. All reptiles are poikilothermic (cold-blooded), which means their body temperature fluctuates related to its external environment. They broadly fall into the following categories; desert (or arid), tropical, temperate or aquatic. These designations generally refer to their natural habitat and result in temperature and humidity needs to accommodate in their habitats in your home. There are great options in each category, and they all make great pets for different reasons.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Tortoises</h3>', 'storage/1630920366.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-06 15:26:06', '2021-09-06 15:26:06'),
(184, 113, '<p>There is a wide variety of tortoises to consider, and the environmental and dietary requirements are different by type. Tortoises are represented in desert (arid), tropical and temperate varieties. Red-footed tortoises are a popular tropical species due to their beautiful appearance and temperament.</p>\r\n<p>Despite differences between tortoise species and individuals, the following generalizations or tendencies can be considered:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Friendly and outgoing. Tortoises tend to be social and will eagerly interact with their human family members.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Life span:</strong> Depending on the species, a tortoise that is well cared for can live 50 years or more.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Russian tortoises can grow 6 to 8 inches, Red-footed tortoises will grow from 11 to 14 inches long. Other tortoises can grow to be hundreds of pounds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Habitat needs:</strong> A tortoise needs a living area with enough room to roam while remaining safe and secure, with a screened cover to allow light but also provide protection. Tortoises also enjoy a cave or box for hiding, which can be filled with digestible substrate such as alfalfa, or a substrate such as forest bedding or Repti Bark that allows for burrowing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diet:</strong> Some tortoises are herbivores and others are omnivores. Tortoises require a diet high in fiber and calcium and low in protein and fat. Select vegetables, fruits and specialized commercial diets can also be supplemented for a balanced diet. Twenty percent of an omnivorous tortoise’s diet should be made up of insects such as earthworms, waxworms, etc. Red-footed tortoises benefit from an occasional frozen/thawed pinkie.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional care needs:</strong> Tortoises need 12 to 14 hours of light each day, which must be provided by natural sunlight or a UVB lighting source. They will also need a constant and clean source of water provided in a shallow container that’s big enough for them to walk in and out of, soak in and drink from.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Turtles</h3>', 'storage/1630920417.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-06 15:26:57', '2021-09-06 15:26:57'),
(185, 113, '<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Generally gentle (with some exceptions) and cautious, turtles will also learn to recognize their pet parent and know when it is feeding time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Turtle size can vary greatly depending on the species, so be sure to research how big the specific type of turtle you’re interested in could grow to be. For example, the red-ear slider — a common pet aquatic turtle — ranges from 5 to 12 inches, and Western painted turtles usually grow to between 4 and 10 inches.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Habitat needs:</strong> Turtles are either aquatic, semi-aquatic or semi-terrestrial. The semi-terrestrials are sufficiently land-based to qualify as land turtles and can be kept in terrarium-style habitats. But all turtles need water to either swim or soak in, and the ability to “bask” on dry land, depending on species.</p>\r\n<p>The size of your turtle’s habitat should be determined by how big they will grow. Semi-terrestrial turtles need some comfy substrate to burrow in, such as forest bedding, as well as a place to hide. Aquatic turtles will require an appropriately sized tank or pond with a filter. Aquatic turtles will only eat when in the water so that needs to be accounted for when building their habitat. All turtles need UVA/UVB lighting (or natural sunlight), heat lamp, basking rock or log, submersible heater and efficient filtration system to help keep the water clean as they swim, eat, drink and eliminate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diet:</strong> Turtles are omnivores that enjoy dark, leafy green veggies and finely chopped vegetables as 40 to 60% of their diet. Commercial turtle food should make up the balance of their diet, such as freeze-dried krill, comet goldfish, and worms and insects as treats. Commercially prepared pelleted and canned diets are formulated with their specific nutritional needs in mind. If your turtle is aquatic, provide turtle food that is developed for water feeding, like floating pellets.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional care needs:</strong> To keep their body temperature properly regulated, turtles require a heated or warm area and a cooler (but not cold) area in their habitats. Thermometers and heat lamps can help provide a proper environment for your turtle. A filtration system (if you have an aquatic turtle that spends time in an aquarium) and regular water changes will help keep their water clean.</p>\r\n<h3>3.

Their diet should consist of 70% insects such as crickets, mealworms, roaches and superworms with 30% made up of mixed fruit and vegetables. Additional offerings of highly nutritious waxworms and hornworms can be given as a treat (less than 20% of the diet). Bearded dragons can also benefit from being fed a commercial bearded dragon food. Calcium and vitamin supplementation is necessary, either in the form of a food additive or by feeding vitamin-enriched worms and crickets, and a vitamin- and mineral-fortified commercial diet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional care needs:</strong> Your bearded dragon habitat will need to include a heat lamp, UVA/UVB lighting source, thermometer and humidity gauge. Bearded dragons need a <a href=\"https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/category/reptile/decor-hideaways/reptile-hideaways\">“hide” to perch on</a> and to get out of the basking area when needed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous things to consider:</strong> Due to their solitary nature, size and their territorial instincts as they mature, bearded dragons should not be kept together in the same habitat.</p>\r\n<h3>4.

Additionally, there are specialized leopard gecko food formulas enriched with the vitamins they need.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional care needs:</strong> Leopard geckos require a basking spot in their habitat with the proper heat to regulate their body temperature. While not considered mandatory for this nocturnal species, UVA/UVB is recommended, as this has been shown to improve health and maintain immune system function. They also shed regularly, so supplies such as moist moss or vermiculite to raise humidity levels allow for proper shedding. Because leopard geckos catch food with their tongues, an appropriate substrate designed specifically for leopard geckos should be used.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous things to consider:</strong> Leopard geckos are nocturnal, so they are most active during the evening and don’t mind being left alone during the day.</p>\r\n<h3>5.

Some have a less-friendly personality and would be best for experienced keepers, but others are docile and can be easily socialized, making excellent first-time pets. Examples of popular pet snakes include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Ball python</li>\r\n<li>Red-tailed boa</li>\r\n<li>Corn snake</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Life span:</strong> Pythons and boas can live up to 30 years with excellent care, though this would not be considered average. Corn snakes live up to about 10 years and other colubrid such as king snakes can live up to 20 years. On average, snakes have a relatively long life when properly cared for.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Size should be a primary consideration when thinking about adding a snake to your home. Size will vary depending on the type of snake. Some popular snakes that are generally 5 feet long or less include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li>Ball python</li>\r\n<li>Corn snake</li>\r\n<li>Rosy boa</li>\r\n<li>California king snake</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Habitat needs:</strong> The size of habitat necessary for your snake will greatly depend on the type of snake you choose. Snakes do not typically need an overly large habitat. For example, a mature ball python could live in a 40-gallon tank. The general rule is that the habitat should not be any shorter than half the snake’s body length.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diet:</strong> Snakes are carnivores, and their specific diet will vary depending on their species. Most eat rodents. Frozen rodents are a more convenient alternative to live ones.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional care needs:</strong> As cold-blooded animals, snakes need to bask in the sun or under heat lamps to warm their body and regulate their metabolism. Each species will have specific heating needs. Research the type of snake you’re interested in to determine the correct range of habitat temperatures for them. Some snakes are terrestrial, which means they spend most or all their time on the ground, and others are arboreal, meaning they climb and prefer to be elevated. Substrate, basking branches and hideaways are designed for each type.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous things to consider:</strong> The personality and care of your snake will vary greatly depending on the species, so be sure to check with a veterinarian to determine which species will be best for you based on your personal situation. Frozen/thawed rodents are the recommended diet, but in some rare instances, some snakes will accept only live rodents.</p>\r\n<h2>A few additional pets to consider</h2>\r\n<h3>6.

Mantella frogs can be as tiny as 1 inch, and Pacman frogs can grow up to 8 inches.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Habitat needs:</strong> The habitat requirements for your frog will vary depending on the species. Some are primarily terrestrial, and others are arboreal and need places to climb. Ample décor to provide hiding places and dechlorinated water provided in a soaking dish all contribute to a happy frog. All pet frogs are tropical and need high humidity. A UVA/UVB lighting source is not strictly required, although it is recommended. Even a small amount of UVB light can be beneficial, especially as it relates to vitamin D3 production.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diet:</strong> Frogs are carnivores and eat “meat” only. Smaller frogs eat insects including fruit flies and small or pinhead crickets, and larger frogs eat larger insects including crickets and worms. Some large frogs such as adult Pacman frogs eat small rodents. A well-rounded frog diet will also include a food that’s formulated to meet your frog species’ specific nutritional needs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional care needs:</strong> Different varieties of frogs will need different additional care needs, like extra lighting, water to bask in, heating, etc. Be sure to check what the specific habitat needs are for the type of frog you’re getting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous things to consider:</strong> Frogs make interesting pets and setting up a terrarium (habitat) can be fun and creative. Frogs are ideal as an observation pet rather than an interactive companion, and gloves should be worn if handling is necessary to avoid toxin transmission (only certain species) and to prevent oils from your skin being absorbed by the frog.</p>\r\n<h3>7.

Items you’ll need to purchase for your bearded dragon include:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listCircle\">\r\n<li><strong>Substrate</strong>: This is the material that goes on the floor of your pet’s habitat. Calcium-based sand works well, but repti-carpet can be a good option, too. Silica sand must be avoided, as it can cause GI impaction if ingested.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Light, temperature and humidity devices</strong>: Bearded dragons need full-spectrum UVB lighting for 10 to 12 hours a day. Incandescent bulbs can only be used during daylight hours, while ceramic heaters or black heat lights can be used at any time. Because bearded dragons cannot regulate their own body temperatures, you’ll need to set up their habitats with that in mind. For optimal comfort, maintain one side of the habitat at approximately 100 degrees F and the other at 70 F. Keep the humidity at less than 50 percent.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Décor</strong>: Adding faux plants, basking branches and hiding spots to your bearded dragon’s habitat can mimic their natural environment and help them feel more at home. Never add items from your own outdoor environment to your bearded dragon’s habitat, however, as they may be harmful.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Water and food dishes</strong>: Your pet should always have access to water, both to drink or lie in if they desire. Worm dishes are usually designed so that worms cannot wiggle their way out, but they can be used for anything you feed your bearded dragon.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A correctly sized habitat</strong>: A healthy adult bearded dragon can grow to 18 to 20 inches long, so providing them with the proper habitat throughout their life is very important.<br>&nbsp;<br>For baby bearded dragons, both Neil and Brandenburg suggest at least a 20-gallon tank, and then upgrading to a 40-gallon tank as they become full-sized adults.

In general, you should plan to feed your young bearded dragon a mix of 70 percent live insects like mealworms or crickets and 30 percent fresh veggies and fruit. Juvenile dragons can eat a larger portion of live food as they work up their taste for fruits and vegetables. As they reach adulthood, your bearded dragon will primarily eat 70-80 percent fruits and vegetables, supplemented with 20-30 percent insects and other protein sources. The commercial Bearded dragon food that you’ll find in My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;is specially formulated to help these animals meet their particular nutritional needs, so that’s a good option, as well.</p>\r\n<p>While juvenile bearded dragons should be fed every day, adult dragons (those 1 year and older) can be fed three to five times a week.

(195, 115, '<p>Your reptile has certain biological needs, and this guide will help you set up a habitat that meets those needs.</p>\r\n<p>When creating a habitat for your new reptilian friend it is important that your terrarium doesn’t just look like your reptile’s natural environment, it also acts like it. Your reptile has certain biological needs, and this guide will help you set up a habitat that meets those needs. Let’s get creating the perfect space for your new friend.</p>\r\n<h4>Your Reptile’s Basic Environmental Needs</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Space</strong></p>\r\n<p>A larger habitat is always preferred. Larger habitats allow you to set up a more effective thermal gradient.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Temperature</strong></p>\r\n<p>Reptiles are cold-blooded animals, so they are unable to regulate their body temperatures on their own. This is why a heating source is critical. Most reptiles need a constant temperature between 70 to 85 degrees F with basking areas that reach over 100 degrees F. This number is different for each species, time of day and season.</p>\r\n<p>A wide range of reptile heating devices including light bulbs, pads, tubular heaters, under-tank heaters, ceramic heating elements and basking lights are available to regulate the temperature environment for your new reptile. You\'ll need to research your particular species or ask a My Puppy My Pet&nbsp;associate to determine your herp’s optimal requirements.</p>\r\n<p>\"Basking\" reptiles move in and out of sunlight to gain the heat they need, which is their form of thermoregulation. A basking lamp set up on one end of their terrarium will give your pet a temperature gradient that will allow them access to heat for digestion purposes and a cooler area for sleeping or resting.</p>\r\n<p>Be sure the low ambient temperature doesn\'t fall below the low-end of your pet\'s ideal temperature range even with all the lights off. Ceramic heating elements and under tank heaters are advantageous because they maintain heat without the need to keep the light on 24 hours a day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Humidity</strong></p>\r\n<p>Depending on the reptile you have, they may require different amounts of humidity or need different methods utilized to introduce moisture into their environment. Tropical Iguanas and other similar species require high humidity levels to maintain their health. Many different types of Chameleons rely on droplets of water on foliage or the sides of their habitats to drink rather than standing water. Every species has preferences when it comes to moisture, so become familiar with what types of moisture your pet will need and what equipment you will need to provide.</p>\r\n<p>Moisture levels are controlled by ventilation, temperature and the introduction of water into the atmosphere. You can raise the humidity level by spraying the air with water frequently or by providing a source of standing or running water. Use a hygrometer in your pet\'s habitat to track humidity. You can maintain the appropriate level of humidity in your pet\'s habitat through commercially available humidifiers, misters and aeration devices. Decorative mini-waterfalls are growing more popular, not only to add interest to the vivarium set-up, but also to provide appropriate humidity levels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Light</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lighting is another factor that varies greatly by species. Lizards, such as Collared Lizards and Green Iguanas, require certain amounts of light exposure each day, while nocturnal reptiles require more subdued lighting.</p>\r\n<p>Basking species need special lamps, correct positioning and even specific light bulbs. They require vitamin D3, which they typically obtain from direct sunlight. D3 helps your little lizard absorb calcium. Normal household lightbulbs cannot provide this, so be sure you find an ultraviolet bulb. Your reptile will need to get within 12 inches of the light. Be sure there is a barrier to avoid risk of burns.</p>\r\n<h4>Before you build</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Cedar &amp; pine shavings</strong></p>\r\n<p>These shavings contain oils that may irritate the skin of some reptiles and they are not appropriate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Heat lamps</strong></p>\r\n<p>Heat lamps should always be mounted well above the enclosure or with a barrier so there is no risk of injury to your reptile.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Driftwood &amp; rocks</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you find and want to use a nice piece of driftwood or a rock for your terrarium, be sure to take the proper precautions. You must soak all décor n a light bleach/water solution for 24 hours. Next, soak it in clean water for another 24 hours to clean it of the bleach. Do not ever place items found outdoors in your terrarium as they may harbor dangerous organisms or bacteria.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Filters</strong></p>\r\n<p>A filter is not needed for a terrarium, but it is a necessary part of a vivarium or aquatic setup. You will need to change it regularly to remove bacteria and other toxins that form in the water or in the filter itself. Read the label and make a note of when to change the filter. If the water looks dirty, it\'s time for a change.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Branches</strong></p>\r\n<p>Living wood should never be used as a pet habitat decoration. The sap could be harmful to your pet. With aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, the sap can actually contaminate the water. You should never use items obtained from outside for your reptile’s home.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Metal objects</strong></p>\r\n<p>Metal object are best kept out of terrariums, particularly in aquatic, semi-aquatic or humid environments. Heavy metals such as copper, zinc and lead are toxic and can contribute to gradual poisoning of your pet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Plants</strong></p>\r\n<p>Finding a plant for your terrarium can be very tricky. You want it to look natural, but above all you want it to be safe. Many plants are toxic to your pet and can cause a reaction anywhere from minor itching to death. Never use a plant from outside as a decoration in your reptile’s habitat.</p>\r\n<p>The signs a plant is causing an allergic reaction for your reptile:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Swelling, particularly around the mouth</li>\r\n<li>Breathing problems</li>\r\n<li>Vomiting</li>\r\n<li>Skin irritation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you notice any of these signs, take your pet to a veterinarian immediately. These reactions are often life-threatening.</p>\r\n<p>These are the basic elements that will help you set up a home for your new reptile friend. Remember every species has different needs, and as a pet parent you will want to provide them with everything that they need to live a long, healthy life. Be sure to research the specific needs of your type of reptile and bring any questions you may have to your veterinarian.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-16 13:00:20', '2021-09-16 13:00:20'),

(199, 117, '<p>Guinea pigs can make excellent companions for a pet parent wanting a smaller, inside pet, however they can also be far from quiet! Guinea pigs are naturally very social animals, so it’s no surprise they have an array of vocalizations and body language behaviors to communicate with other guinea pigs and their human companions to express their moods, wants, and needs.</p>\r\n<p>If you already have a guinea pig at home, or have been researching guinea pigs in anticipation of bringing one home as a companion, you probably noticed they have quite the vocabulary and are often seen chittering, squealing, or purring, along with displaying unusual behaviors such as bouncing around or throwing their head in the air. All of these noises and behaviors have significant meaning to what a guinea pig is trying to communicate, although some can be quite complex.</p>\r\n<h2>Guinea Pig Sounds</h2>\r\n<p>Some common noises you may hear from your guinea pig may include whistling, purring, or teeth chattering. Whistling or “wheeking” which is a high-pitched sound guinea pigs call out as “WheeeeEEEKKK!” is generally expressed in excitement. Guinea pigs may vocalize this sound when they see a new guinea pig or at sight of their human. It is often heard around feeding time or when treats are present. Purring can mean different emotions, so context must be considered as well as body language. A lower-pitched purr can mean your guinea pig is content while a higher pitched purr may symbolize annoyance or even fear. Hissing and teeth chattering are behaviors displayed when your guinea is annoyed or angry. This may be displayed towards other guinea pigs, other pets, or even you if your pet is wanting to be left alone. Yawning, where a guinea pig displays their teeth, may follow teeth chattering as a warning that your pig wants space.</p>\r\n<p>There are also many less common vocalizations that may only be heard from guinea pigs in specific situations. Cooing is a soothing sound for guinea pigs and often heard from mother guinea pigs reassuring their babies. Rumbling is a deep purring noise that is generally heard when guinea pigs are wanting to mate or trying to win over another piggy friend. A severely loud, high-pitched shriek is a sign of significant fear or pain from your guinea pig and should not be ignored. Chirping is another unusual sound that you may hear from your guinea pig although it’s not common and experts still are not exactly sure the meaning behind this communication.</p>\r\n<h2>Guinea Pig Body Language Speaks Volumes</h2>\r\n<p>Beyond audible vocalizations, guinea pigs are also known for several significant body language displays that further communicate their mood and intentions. Popcorning is one of the most well-known behaviors, where a guinea pig sporadically leaps straight into the air, often repeatedly. This is a sign of an excited, happy guinea pig that is in the mood to play. Chin raising or head bobbing is often done when your guinea pig is annoyed or to display dominance. If this behavior is done when you are petting your guinea pig, they are letting you know that they would prefer to be left alone. Mounting can be a sexual behavior but is also seen between a group of all females or all males to display dominance and sort social structure between a group.</p>\r\n<p>Being aware of and familiar with your guinea pig’s vocalizations and body language will help you have a strong and healthy relationship with your pet. Understanding when your guinea pig is trying to communicate it is enjoying an interaction, stressed, or in discomfort can help you alter your actions to those that are best suited for your pet’s mood and needs.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-16 15:39:31', '2021-09-16 15:39:31'),

This dust can be harmful to your aquatic life if not rinsed thoroughly. New carbon should be rinsed until the dust has diminished and the water runs clear.

Eventually those tiny pores will have attracted and bound with as much contaminates as it can hold, becoming saturated. Typically activated carbon is effective for one month. If there is a heavy bioload in the aquarium or if it is used to remove medications, you may need to change the carbon more frequently.&nbsp; Putting your aquarium on a regular maintenance schedule which includes water changes and carbon replacement in addition to rinsing or replacing your mechanical filter cartridge will help provide an environment in which your aquatic life will thrive and have you seeing clearly!</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-16 16:08:51', '2021-09-16 16:08:51'),
(205, 121, '<p>One of the easiest things to forget when choosing a new aquarium, or even moving to a new home with your current aquarium, is how much your aquarium will weigh when it’s complete, and often it’s a lot more than one would expect! Choosing the right stand, or even the right spot in your home to support that weight is critical for ensuring the security of the aquarium and avoiding disaster for both your new aquatic life, and your home.</p>\r\n<p>To determine the weight of an aquarium, you’ll need to take into consideration the weight of the tank itself, gravel/substrate, décor, equipment, and of course the water. Below is a step by step guide for how to calculate the weight of your aquarium.</p>\r\n<h2>Tank Weight</h2>\r\n<p>Use the chart below to estimate the weight of your tank. The chart includes glass tanks sized 5.5-75 gallons.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Example: A 10G tank weighs 11lbs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Gravel/Substrate Weight</h2>\r\n<p>A good rule of thumb for determining gravel weight is 1 pound for every gallon.&nbsp; You can also use the chart below to estimate the weight of your gravel.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Example: A 10G tank weighs 11lbs. The gravel in the tank will weigh approximately 10lbs. The tank and gravel combined are approximately 21lbs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Water Weight</h2>\r\n<p>1 gallon of water weighs roughly 8.34lbs, and it’s recommended to round up to 10lbs per gallon to leave yourself a nice safety buffer. There will be displacement of water if you add gravel/substrate, but to be safe we recommend calculating 10lbs per gallon of water your tank can hold.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Example: A 10G tank weighs 11lbs. The gravel in the tank will weigh approximately 10lbs. The water in a 10G tank will weigh approximately 100lbs. <b>A 10G tank with gravel and water will weigh approximately 121lbs!</b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Décor and Equipment</h2>\r\n<p>Décor and equipment, such as the filter, can also influence the total weight of your aquarium. All chosen items should list the weight on the packaging, or you can look it up online. For equipment that houses water outside of the aquarium, such as a canister filter, don’t forget to check what volume of water it holds and calculate the additional water weight in as well!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Total Weight</h2>\r\n<p>The numbers in the chart below are a base guideline for glass aquariums, gravel/substrate, and water weight. Any additional equipment and décor will have their own individual weight that will need to be calculated into the total weight estimate. Even though the tank weights below are based on glass aquariums, you can use the same guideline for acrylic aquariums. Acrylic aquariums will weigh slightly less than glass, but it’s always best to over-estimate the weight rather than underestimate, so you’ll still be safe utilizing the weight chart below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"624\">\r\n<tbody><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><b><i>Tank Gallons</i></b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>Dimensions</b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>Tank Weight</b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>Water Weight</b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>Gravel Weight</b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p><b>Aquarium, Gravel &amp; Water Weight</b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>5.5</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>16.50”L x 10.75”H x 8.75”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>8lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>50.5lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>5.5lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>64lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>10</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>20.25”L x 12.625”H x 10.5”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>11lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>100lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>10lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>121lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>15</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>25.00”L x 13.25”H x 13.25”W </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>21lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>150lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>15lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>186lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>20 Long</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>30.50”L x 13.0”H x 13.125”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>25lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>200lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>20lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>245lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>20 High</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>25.00”L x 17.25”H x 13.25”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>25lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>200lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>20lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>245lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>29</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>30.625”L x 19.0”H x 13.25”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>40lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>290lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>29lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>359lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>40</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>36.19”L x 16.94”H x 18.25”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>58lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>400lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>40lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>498lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>55</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>48.75”L x 21.25”H x 14.00”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>78lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>550lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>55lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>683lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p><i>75</i></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"150\" valign=\"top\"><p>49.00”L x 21.25”H x 19.50”W</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\"><p>140lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\"><p>750lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"84\" valign=\"top\"><p>75lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"168\" valign=\"top\"><p>965lbs</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr></tbody></table>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-16 16:11:39', '2021-09-16 16:11:39'),

But to determine which kind of what items you need, first consider the aquatic life you want to keep. Freshwater fish come in all shapes and sizes with wide ranging requirements for their living conditions. Betta fish prefer smaller tanks with almost no current while Oscar cichlids need lots of room to grow and can swim in water with low currents. Understanding the needs of the fish you want will make choosing your tank essentials and accessories that much easier.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"spacer-xsm-top spacer-sm-bottom\">Aquarium Furniture – tanks &amp; stands</h3>\r\n<p>The size of your tank depends on a lot of different factors: how much space do you have, how much weight can you manage (a gallon of water weighs nearly 9 lbs.), and most importantly what kind of aquatic life you want to keep. If your only limiting factor is fish type, remember that most freshwater fish require at least one gallon for every adult inch they are long; some species like goldfish require more.

(208, 123, '<p>When setting up your new leopard gecko’s habitat, one of the more important things to choose is the habitat’s substrate, or the material that covers the bottom of your enclosure. Picking the best substrate can be an overwhelming task; below we will help you navigate a couple options, helping your leopard gecko live a happy and healthy life! Substrate should be absorbent and easy to clean, but also not present a choking hazard or any toxins to your pet if accidently ingested. Substrate should not be overly abrasive to reduce risk of injury to your pet and should also be made of a material that won’t hold or promote too much humidity for this desert species. There are several acceptable substrates that can be used in your leopard gecko’s habitat, each with attributes to address specific needs.&nbsp;</p>', 'storage/1631788705.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-16 16:38:25', '2021-09-16 16:38:25'),
(209, 123, '<h2>Carpet Liner</h2>\r\n<p>Reptile carpet provides a sleek look and can be easily cleaned, helping maintain an ideal habitat for your leopard gecko! Coming in several colors to match your habitat’s theme, reptile carpet is typically made of non-abrasive material to reduce irritation to the sensitive feet or bellies of your pet.&nbsp; Reptile carpet should be spot cleaned as needed and disinfected with a reptile-specific cleaning solution or 3% bleach solution once a week to maintain a healthy home for your pet. For even easier cleaning, pet parents often keep extra sets of reptile carpet so that they can easily be rotated out as one is being disinfected and thoroughly dried. Reptile carpet can be cut to fit any size habitat, making them great for enclosures that may have unique dimensions or shape. Remember that leopard geckos are extremely curious, be sure there are no stray pieces of carpet that they could potentially ingest or get wrapped around their toes! Reptile carpets can be great for geckos that are prone to ingesting too much loose substrate, however they do not encourage natural behaviors like digging and burrowing like loose substrates can. Also, carpet liners may not be ideal for pet parents that prefer a more naturalistic aesthetic for their pet’s habitat.</p>', 'storage/1631788837.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-16 16:40:37', '2021-09-16 16:40:37'),

Reptile calcium sand is not only non-toxic but is fortified with calcium and vitamins which provide increased health benefits when ingested in small amounts, however it should not replace the use of dietary supplements. An added benefit to sand is waste can easily be scooped when spot-cleaning the substrate. Remember, a complete change of substrate should be done during routine disinfection of your gecko’s entire habitat. Calcium sand is formulated to be non-toxic and ultra-fine to reduce the risk of impaction. However, if you find your pet is showing signs of excessively ingesting this substrate, (sand in stool, lack of appetite and lethargy), finding an alternative may be necessary. Due to the risk of over-ingestion and smaller lizard’s digestive systems, sand may also be better suited for larger or adult animals instead of juveniles.</p>', 'storage/1631788896.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-16 16:41:36', '2021-09-16 16:41:36'),

Here are some dog toy basics to keep in mind.</p>\r\n<h2>The importance of play and toys</h2>\r\n<p>Besides the bonding mentioned above (which is a huge perk!), there are other advantages to providing your dog with plenty of opportunities to play throughout the day.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Mental stimulation:</strong> Dogs are, as any dog parent knows, very smart, and giving them mentally stimulating entertainment throughout the day can help keep their brain agile and result in a happier and healthier all-around dog.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Daily exercise is essential for dogs to stay healthy. Just how much yours needs will vary depending on their breed, age, size and other factors. Outside of walks and trips to the dog park, indoor and backyard toys can help your dog fulfill that exercise quotient and release energy throughout the day.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Helps reduce boredom and destruction:</strong> A bored dog can turn into a destructive dog.

(221, 127, '<p>If you’re planning to head outside and brave the elements in the frigid winter months, chances are you’re going to bundle up. You’ll layer on a heavy coat, throw on a knit hat and pull on some boots to keep your toes toasty.</p>\r\n<p>If you take those types of precautions to protect yourself from the cold, you should be aware of how freezing temperatures and winter weather can affect your pets, too.</p>\r\n<p>“Don’t assume that you pet’s fur protects them from the weather like your insulated jacket protects you,” says Vicki Stevens, director of program management and communications in the companion animals department at the Humane Society of the United States. “Remember that if your extremities would need protection—like mittens and a hat—your pet’s extremities will be cold, too.”</p>\r\n<p>Whether you spend the winter sharing blankets with your dog or with a feline friend, make sure to keep these cold weather concerns for pets top of mind.</p>\r\n<h2>How cold is too cold for a dog?</h2>\r\n<p>If you’re wondering how cold is too cold for a dog, the answer isn’t simple, says Dr. Maren Krafchik of the ASPCA Animal Hospital in New York City. “There isn’t one temperature that’s a hard-and-fast rule for all pets, but the best general rule is: If it is too cold for you, it’s too cold for your pet,” she says. “Generally speaking, pets should stay indoors as much as possible during the winter months.”</p>\r\n<p>If dogs stay outdoors too long in freezing temperatures or harsh, winter elements, they may have trouble regulating their body temperature, says Krafchik, and could develop hypothermia. Frostbite is another concern, and exposed areas of skin—such as your dog\'s nose, tail, ears and paw pads—are particularly susceptible.</p>\r\n<p>Signs of hypothermia in dogs include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Shivering </li>\r\n<li>Pale gums </li>\r\n<li>Lack of coordination </li>\r\n<li>Slow heart rate </li>\r\n<li>Stiff muscles </li>\r\n<li>Lethargy </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you are planning on taking a winter walk with you dog, limit the time spent outside, outfit them with proper winter dog gear, and make sure to pay close attention to your pup and watch for warning signs. “Just like people, each pet has their own tolerance for cold, based not only on their coat length and size, but their age, general health and underlying medical conditions,” says Stevens. So, as you are out with your pets, it is important to monitor each of them individually to determine whether they are handling the cold adequately or need additional protection.</p>\r\n<h2>How to keep dogs warm in winter weather</h2>\r\n<p>Dogs still need physical activity during the winter months, so learning to keep dogs warm in winter is an important part of keeping your pet safe.</p>', 'storage/1631790575.jpg', 'imgbanner', '2021-09-16 17:09:35', '2021-09-16 17:09:35'),
(222, 127, '<p>Although not all dogs will tolerate the use of sweaters or coats, these items can be beneficial in minimizing winter’s bite. “These can help retain body heat and prevent skin from getting dry or inflamed,” says Krafchik. “Whether a dog needs a coat depends on many factors, including age, size, breed and fur, so discuss your specific pet’s needs with a veterinarian.”</p>\r\n<p>Dog booties are another good option for pet parents—if dogs will tolerate wearing them, says Stevens. Not only do these coverings help keep your dog warm in the winter, but they help protect your pup from potential dangers. “Rock salt and other chemicals used to melt snow and ice can irritate the pads of your pet\'s feet,” she says. “Dog boots can help protect your dog’s feet from these irritants. Be sure to wipe all paws with a damp towel and check your pets’ feet and pads to look for any chapping or cracking.”</p>\r\n<p>Adding a dog-safe heating pad to your pup’s bed or purchasing a self-heating dog bed can also provide your pet with a little extra warmth when the temperatures drop. But be careful when you are using heating pads in your home, adds Stevens. “Heated beds and pads can be helpful, but they must be used with caution,” she says. “Check frequently to make sure there are no exposed wires that could cause a fire, and do not leave these items on when you are not at home to monitor them.”</p>\r\n<h2>How cold is too cold for a cat?</h2>\r\n<p>If you’re wondering how cold is too cold for a cat, the same rule applies to cats as it does to dogs. “Again, if it is too cold for you, it’s too cold for your pet,” says Krafchik.</p>\r\n<p>Single-digit temperatures and freezing weather can cause a variety of problems for felines who are exposed to the elements, especially strays and outdoor cats. “Cats can die from hypothermia and frequently seek heat from car engines, which can result in fan-belt injuries, burns and death,” adds Krafchik.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the extreme cold can increase a cat\'s energy and nutritional needs, says Krafchik, so make sure to provide your cat with extra water and encourage drinking to prevent dehydration.</p>\r\n<p>It is recommended to keep your feline family members inside, especially during lower temperatures. If you notice strays in your area, contact a local animal shelter or humane society to let them know about the animal and to provide guidance.</p>\r\n<h2>How to keep cats warm during winter</h2>\r\n<p>The simple rule of thumb for helping cats stay warm in the winter? Keep them inside. “Cats are healthiest and safest indoors,” says Krafchik. “This applies through all seasons, but most importantly through winter.”</p>\r\n<p>Provide your cat with plenty of enrichment activities inside, such as cat trees or food puzzles. Your feline will be happiest watching the winter weather from a cozy perch near the window. And since cat’s generally don’t tolerate “gear” as much as dogs, says Krafchik, it’s really not advisable to let cats outside.</p>\r\n<p>If you’re looking to keep outside cats warm, there are ways you can help. First, call your local animal shelter if you see an outdoor stray or cat colony. Many cat rescue groups will provide food, shelter and blankets to feral or stray cats in the winter.</p>\r\n<p>If you’ve noticed outside cats in your neighborhood during the winter months, make sure to check under your car and knock on the hood before starting the engine. This can help scare outside cats away and prevent potential burns and injuries for cats who are hiding in or near vehicles.</p>\r\n<h2>Cold weather concerns for pets: Use your judgment</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes down to it, it’s not worth putting your pet’s health and safety at risk. Cut down on outdoor exposure during the winter months and make sure to keep your pets active with fun indoor games—like hide-and-seek—or interactive toys.</p>\r\n<p>“Check your local listings for indoor-play opportunities—such as doggie day care,” says Krafchik. “If your pet is very active, you may want to have extra enrichment, such as toys, puzzle toys and obedience exercises to keep them busy while indoors.”</p>\r\n<p>For more interactive toys and games to play with your pet this winter, visit Mypuppymypet.com.au</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-16 17:10:21', '2021-09-16 17:10:21'),

Make sure the hot and busy season stays fun and safe for you and your best friend.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Keeping your dog hydrated</h2>\r\n<p>A key to making sure you don\'t have a dehydrated dog is to keep fresh water available at all times. You may not see your dog drinking water very often, but that\'s all the more reason why it should be readily available when they do decide it\'s time to stop for a drink. <br>\r\nMoving water tends to feel colder, which is why dogs like drinking water that\'s in motion (like from the faucet). An automatic water fountain is a great option for keeping your dog hydrated and many have built-in filters to help water stay cleaner than still, stagnant water.</p>\r\n<p>Another way to encourage dog hydration is to have multiple, wide water dishes placed in the areas of your home where your dog hangs out.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Eating for hydration</h2>\r\n<p>You can also add water to your dog\'s food, and provide wet food that contains higher moisture levels.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>A cool comb-out</h2>\r\n<p>One way you can keep your dog cool in warm weather is to maintain a good grooming routine. Brushing away old hair is like taking off your dog’s sweater. A clean, sleek pooch will feel refreshed on a summer day.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Warm weather walks</h2>\r\n<p>If the sidewalk is \"hot enough to fry an egg,\" it\'s too hot for your dog\'s paw pads. Since a pair of flip-flops won\'t fit on your pooch, walk your dog on cooler surfaces like grass or a dirt trail. On extremely hot days, it\'s smart just to keep your best friend inside with the AC and lots of fresh water.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Beach play is fun, but take breaks</h2>\r\n<p>If you wore a fur coat to the beach, you\'d likely want a break to cool down too. Keep plenty of drinking water and your dog\'s travel bowl on hand, and locate a nice shady spot where your pooch can get out of the sun. A beach umbrella works well too.<br>\r\nAnytime your dog is spending time in the sun, apply pet-safe sunscreen to your dog\'s ears, nose and anywhere else they have bare skin or thin fur.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Kiddie pools aren\'t just for kids</h2>\r\n<p>Running around the yard will be more fun with the occasional doggie dip to cool down. A kiddie pool is a great, low-maintenance option, especially if your dog isn\'t much of a swimmer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\">\"More pets go missing on the Fourth of July than any other day of the year.\"</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Managing the Fourth of July stress</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"spacer-sm-left\">\r\n<li>Pet parents may love fireworks, but they can be a dog\'s worst nightmare. More pets go missing on the Fourth of July than any other day of the year. Some simple measures can keep your pooch at ease:</li>\r\n<li>During the festivities, keep your dog indoors with the windows closed. Make sure your dog\'s crate or \"safe place\" is easily accessible. Playing soft music can make your friend feel more comfortable.</li>\r\n<li>Don\'t scold your dog for anxious behavior and resist the urge to talk in a calming voice. This will only confirm that there\'s something to be worried about. Just act normal, and talk in an upbeat voice. Encourage good behavior by rewarding with treats.</li>\r\n<li>Consider the use of calming aids like the Thundershirt or homeopathic remedies designed to promote a sense of calm.</li>\r\n<li>Be sure that the information on your dog\'s ID tag is current. This will ensure the quick recovery of a runaway pooch.

(224, 129, '<p>Snow, ice, frigid temperatures - the winter months bring an array of frosty weather conditions that all spell one thing: cold! Even though winter presents a unique set of challenges for pet parents, you can keep your indoor dog healthy, happy and warm with a few helpful tips.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Combat the Cold</h2>\r\n<p>Although it may seem obvious, keeping your pet indoors is one of the best ways to help him combat cold weather and avoid the danger of hypothermia and frostbite. Exposed areas of skin - such as your dog\'s nose, tail, ears and paw pads - are particularly susceptible to frostbite.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe your dog prefers to spend his winter days in perfect comfort - curled up on the sofa, watching out the window as the snowflakes fall. But for those unavoidable outdoor excursions to take a quick walk or a potty break, you\'ll want to help your pet be as comfortable as possible. You might want to shop for protective clothing that will help your dog beat the outdoor chill. A comfy coat or sweater and a set of pet booties will keep him toasty warm during his (short) trips outside.</p>\r\n<p>The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) cautions against leaving your dog outside in the colder months as the wind chill factor can be life-threatening. If, for some reason, your dog is outside in cold weather for extended periods of time, provide appropriate shelter that is warm, dry and has a floor that is raised a few inches off the ground and is covered with straw or cedar shavings. You might also consider a heated pad or bed to place in your dog\'s shelter, which should be large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around and lie down in comfortably, but small enough to maintain body heat. Your dog should have access to fresh, clean water at all times. A heated pet dish can prevent the water from becoming frozen.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Focus on Feet</h2>\r\n<p>While keeping your pet primarily indoors is effective, when your dog does venture outdoors, you\'ll want to keep a close eye out for \"ice balls\" on his feet, as these can build up and cause pain or frostbite. You should be vigilant in protecting your dog from antifreeze and only use pet-safe de-icing salts in any areas where your dog might walk. If you\'re walking your dog in areas where he might inadvertently step in poisonous antifreeze or non-pet-safe de-icing salts, wipe or wash your dog\'s paws, legs and even belly after a walk to remove the chemicals. Your dog could accidentally ingest them by licking his paws if you don\'t take precautions.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Strive for Safety </h2>\r\n<p>The weather outside may be frightful, but that fire might not be so delightful for your dog. Make sure that your pet stays safe around your fireplace and never leave him unattended when a fire is going. Install a protective fireplace screen or pet gate that allows you to enjoy the warmth and beauty of the fire while keeping your dog from going too close to the flames.</p>\r\n<p>We\'re all aware of the dangers of keeping a pet in the car on a hot day, but cold temperatures can also pose dangers to a dog left unattended in a vehicle. To avoid hypothermia, never leave your pet unattended in a car.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Hone in on Health</h2>\r\n<p>Your dog may not be as active during the winter months and this could result in weight gain. To help your pet maintain a healthy weight during the winter months, provide plenty of indoor playtimes. Try a mentally challenging game of hide and seek with your dog’s favorite toys. Consider taking your dog to a daycare facility for a day of fun, which can help your dog expend energy.</p>\r\n<p>Cold weather can also be difficult for dogs that suffer from arthritis, so you might want to consider an orthopedic bed to maximize your dog\'s comfort. If the cold weather seems to be affecting your pet\'s joints more than usual, talk to your veterinarian about joint supplements or other options.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-16 17:13:14', '2021-09-16 17:13:14'),

Start by setting up a cozy space or area in a bedroom that is off limits to guests and away from trick-or-treaters. Add their favorite snuggly bed, food, water, litter box and toys so the area feels familiar. Playing soft music or having the TV on may help block out scary sounds that can stress your pet. Also consider using calming aids like chews or diffusers to help your pet relax through the festivities. Keep reading for additional precautions to consider.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Keep all candy out of reach</h3>\r\n<p>Chocolate can diminish blood flow to the brain and cause heart attacks and a variety of other life-threatening problems for cats. As a rule, the darker the chocolate, the more lethal it is. Other types of candy can also be toxic and/or damage your cat’s teeth. As such, keep chocolate and all other candy away from your pet. If you have trick-or-treating children, be sure they dump out candy in a cat-free zone and let them know why they can’t share with the pets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>2. Make your cat visible and easy to identify</h3>\r\n<p>Make sure your cat is wearing a collar with an ID tag in the event they break free from their \"safe room.\" A glow-in-the-dark or reflective collar and tag are ideal. These will help you spot your cat if they do slip out of the house while also improving a motorist’s chance of seeing your pet.</p>\r\n<p>Microchipping your cat is an effective and permanent way to up the odds of a happy reunion if you and your pet are ever separated. Once the chip has been implanted, a lost pet who shows up at an animal shelter or vet clinic just needs to be scanned for their pet parent’s contact information to be revealed. If your cat has yet to be microchipped, contact your veterinarian or find a Vetco clinic to set up a microchipping appointment.</p>\r\n<p>If your pet does become lost, post flyers in your neighborhood, contact local veterinarians and shelters and visit Petco Love Lost to upload a photo of your lost pet into their database.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Pick a costume designed with your cat in mind</h3>\r\n<p>While DIYs can be great for many things, crafting a costume that keeps your cat comfortable and safe can be difficult. Since dressing up may be new to your cat, opt for a costume that was designed specifically for them. Petco’s Bootique collection runs the gamut from spooky to silly. Even better, really get your kitty involved in the festivities by opting for a matching getup.</p>', 'storage/1631791528.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-16 17:25:28', '2021-09-16 17:25:28'),
(230, 131, '<h3>4. Pick up loose wrappers</h3>\r\n<p>Are you known for having the best homemade treats on your block? If trick-or-treaters line up at your door for goodies wrapped in plastic or tin foil, be careful. While these materials help you create festive sweets, they can be life-threatening to your pet. If ingested, they can cause a blockage in your cat’s stomach or GI tract so be sure to take extra precaution when working with decorative wrapping.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Choose cat-safe decorations</h3>\r\n<p>The magic of Halloween is all in the decorations. At the same time, it’s important to consider the potential dangers things like manmade cobwebs and plastic or glass décor pose. If ingested, shards from a broken glass decoration can puncture an intestinal wall, string lights pose a possible shock risk if chewed, and cobwebs can cause an internal blockage. To avoid this, vacuum or sweep floors right after decorating, cover all electrical cords and ensure your cat can’t knock over or climb up any decorations you put up.</p>', 'storage/1631791598.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-16 17:26:38', '2021-09-16 17:26:38'),
(231, 131, '<h3>6. Place candles beyond reach</h3>\r\n<p>A careless swipe of the tail, the swat of a curious paw or a nose that gets too close can lead to singed fur and whiskers or a serious burn, not to mention a house fire that will put everyone in danger. Place candles and jack-o-lanterns well out of your cat\'s reach or swap them out for battery-powered decorations that don’t require an open flame.</p>\r\n<h2>What to do in an emergency</h2>\r\n<p>You should always have a good contact number for your veterinarian, a local emergency clinic for care after normal business hours and&nbsp; the <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control\">ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center’s</a> number (9876543210) that you can call right away in case of emergency (If you do opt to contact the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, know there may be a charge for the call). All of them will be familiar with Halloween related illnesses and injuries and can instruct you on caring for your feline. Keep those numbers in your phone and written down somewhere else, too. You can also prepare for emergencies by reading up on a few common issues and know how to respond in addition to contacting a professional.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Burns</strong>: Douse the affected area with cold water and/or apply a cool compress, and contact your veterinarian.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Stomach blockages or perforated intestines</strong>: You may not notice symptoms right away. Instead, it may take a day or two after your cat ingests a harmful object to observe a change in their eating and litter box habits. If you see a string protruding from your cat\'s mouth or anus, do not try to remove it. Your attempt to do so may further harm their intestines. In either situation, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Poisoning or toxicity</strong>: Your cat may become hypersensitive to stimuli such as light, noise and sound, causing their pupils to dilate. Other symptoms include a rapid heartbeat, muscle tremors, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperactivity or difficulty breathing. Contact your veterinarian, emergency clinic or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center if you notice any unusual symptoms in your cat. Collect a sample of the substance consumed, as well as any vomit or feces expelled. You will need to take these with you to the veterinarian\'s office.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>By following our Halloween pet safety tips and knowing what to do if something goes wrong, you’re taking the necessary precautions.

(232, 132, '<p>The holidays can be a wonderful — if somewhat harried — time, not just for humans, but for our pets as well. Cats, especially, who generally tend to appreciate a calmer, more routine existence, may begin to feel a bit overwhelmed by busy families who are finishing last-minute holiday errands, a never-ending stream of guests and new smells and decorations, among other things. Before you pull out the tinsel and poinsettias, here are some things to consider when it comes to your cat’s comfort this time of year.</p>\r\n<h2>How to decorate for the holidays with cats in mind</h2>\r\n<p>Remember that while you may love all the holiday bits and baubles you pull out from the crawlspace to decorate with, some of those items may be dangerous for your feline friend. Since cats are curious by nature and will be attracted to shiny, blinking and sparkling things, here are some things to keep in mind when decorating this year:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keep strings of lights and garland away from cats so they don’t become tangled in them</li>\r\n<li>Avoid objects that could potentially be swallowed, like tinsel and ribbon</li>\r\n<li>Consider electric candles rather than real ones, since cats attracted to the flickering light could burn themselves or knock the candle over</li>\r\n<li>Keep fragile ornaments that cats may try and bat off your tree high up (or avoid them altogether)</li>\r\n<li>Ensure that your tree is secure and, if possible, in an area where your cat can’t get to it to climb</li>\r\n<li>Cover tree stand water that could contain harmful tree oils and bacteria to keep your cat from drinking it</li>\r\n<li>Keep holiday plants out of reach of cats who may try and nibble them</li>\r\n</ul>', 'storage/1631791745.jpg', 'imgSquare', '2021-09-16 17:29:05', '2021-09-16 17:29:05'),
(233, 132, '<h3>Are poinsettia plants poisonous to cats?</h3>\r\n<p>While poinsettia plants are generally not deadly to cats, if ingested, they can cause stomach issues, vomiting and swelling of the tissue in the mouth and throat. Another popular holiday plant — Amaryllis — invokes the same reaction.</p>\r\n<p>However, other holiday plants can be poisonous to cats, so keep your pet away from mistletoe, holly, yew and lilies. Pine needles are also dangerous for cats as the oils are toxic and the needs can cause internal obstructions. So when picking your Christmas tree, opt for a different variety or, even better, get a beautiful fake one with soft bristles.</p>\r\n<h2>What to do if a cat hides from visitors</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you’re throwing a huge holiday shindig or just expecting a couple of guests for dinner, there’s always a chance that your cat — especially if they tend to be shy, anyway — might not welcome the intrusion. If you’re having people over and your cat hides, keep the following in mind:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Remember that this is normal behavior</strong>. It’s pretty common for cats to avoid loud noises, unfamiliar smells or anything else that tends to differ from their normal routine. With that in mind, you can focus on ways to make it a more pleasant experience for everyone, including your nervous furry friend.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Provide a safe, quiet space</strong>. If your cat is particularly skittish around your holiday guests, consider setting up a quiet, calm area where they can feel safe and remain unbothered. Make it a room that’s away from the fray and consider bringing your cat’s food, water and litter into this area so they don’t have to leave. Providing a favorite bed, comfy blanket and toys can help calm the nerves of an out-of-sorts cat, as well.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Get additional help</strong>. For some added help, cat pheromone spray or diffusers can provide an extra calming effect.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>How to enjoy the holidays with your cat</h2>\r\n<p>Once you’ve safely decorated, kept any hazardous items at bay and provided a calm and safe spot for your cat to avoid any guests, it’s time to focus on enjoying the holidays with your beloved furry friend. Some easy ways to do that include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Include their likeness as part of the décor</strong>. Keep your cat part of holiday spirit even when they aren’t in the room by including them in the décor. My Puppy My Pet has a full line of ornaments that you can personalize to your pet, including engraving your pet’s name in them, adding a photo or putting a paw print in clay. It’s a memory that’ll last for years to come.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Start a tradition</strong>. Whether it’s a certain homemade treat or gift that your cat only gets at this special time of year, an outing (if your cat enjoys that kind of thing) or something else, creating a tradition to share with your cat every year at this time will make it even more fun to celebrate.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Slow down and savor the moment</strong>. Things can get quite hectic this time of year, so be sure to build in some extra down time to spend cuddling your cat. It’s the perfect opportunity to show just how much we love them all year-round.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br>With a little thought and planning, the holiday season can be an extra special time for you and your cat.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2021-09-16 17:29:21', '2021-09-16 17:29:21');

We close the cover, quilt the Futon to keep the filling in place &amp; then encase it with a removable, washable organic cotton cover. Ideal for the car, weekends away, and they also fit our raised beds such as the Flea-Free Raised Bed.</p>', '1', '71', '1635577676.jpg', '1635577684.jpg', '1635577717.jpg', 'MINI', 'ORIGINAL', 'MIGHTY', NULL, NULL, 79.9, 99.9, 109.9, NULL, NULL, 'Available', 'Available', 'Available', 'Out of Stock', 'Out of Stock', '2021-10-29 23:06:30', 'All measurements are in millimetres (mm)', NULL, 'Length', 'Width', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Small', '520', '420', NULL, NULL, NULL, '830', '530', NULL, NULL, NULL, '980', '680', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'true', 'true', NULL, NULL, '<p>Remove cover before washing</p><p>As this product contains wool &amp; organic cotton, much like your own bedding, it’s important to air it out regularly.
